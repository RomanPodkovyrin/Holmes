      "text": "As the frequent and mild waves crashed into the bow and rocked the boat, Viktor Patrov felt the faint streetlights in Pyon seemed to draw closer and closer. The yellowish lights were scattered and uneven, contrasting the starry winter night. This town looked nothing out of ordinary, yet Viktor welcomed this sight, and could not wait to walk on the roads illuminated by them. This is where things might work out, Viktor thought, trying to lean closer to the bow of the boat to get a better view. ‘Get back down or you will get us killed.’ The captain said quietly but firmly, gesturing to Viktor not to lean out from the canopy. From the tone of his order, Viktor could picture an impatient man and he complied quickly. He took a small breath, hoping the chilling winter air could calm him down, but it did not work. He switched his attention to scanning the surroundings and took a glance at the boat captain, who was piloting quietly at the rear. The captain was wearing a black hoodie, clutching onto the steering wheel tightly and remained silent. His motionless expression offered a certain reassurance to this trip. Viktor remembered how hard it was to get hold of him. This man is one of the most experienced migrant smugglers in this bay, never even been intercepted once, he tried to convince himself when he finally met him in person two hours ago, after having a considerable sum of money being taken from him by the middleman. The captain looked incredibly young - probably in his early twenties – but so far he had been skilfully dodging the Zentrum Union Border Patrol boats, and switching off the engine strategically to avoid detection. He must have an incredible past for this level of skills, albeit not likely to be a pleasant one. ‘Are we there yet?’ asked a young voice coming from Viktor’s right. His daughter was rubbing her eyes as she was sitting up on the bench. Apparently, the last wave had rocked the boat enough to wake her up. ‘We’ll get there soon, Beth.’ Viktor reassured, holding his daughter closer, hoping to share some of his body warmth, but he knew it was far too cold for anyone to be comfortable. We have to do this in winter, Viktor thought, longer nights give us the best chance to succeed. ‘That’s good…’ said Beth, ‘are you doing okay daddy?’ ‘Don’t worry about me, sweetie.’ Viktor kissed Beth on her hair gently, while a heavy amount of guilt built up deep inside. I don’t deserve an angel like her. Looking back on his life, the birth of Beth five years ago was undoubtedly the finest hour. Viktor could never forget that day in the hospital when he witnessed his daughter arriving in this world through the thin window. The overwhelming emotions of happiness, responsibility, and hope had completely changed him since. When he held Beth in the ward for the first time, he knew that he would do anything to protect her. I hope I am doing the right thing. He examined the item on his left hand, a silver portable solid-state drive stowed in his leather bag. The drive stored several sensitive documents that Viktor had managed to download two days before his escape when he was still working as a senior analyst for the Zentrum Union Department for Strategic Development. Naturally, like many defectors before Viktor, sensitive information or wealth is the only bargain chip for one to be offered official protection, but Viktor knew the key to an effective negotiation was getting hold of the right information. And my daughter’s future depends on this bargaining chip, Viktor thought, or they will deport us back to whatever awaits on the other side of the border for a reward. He hoped that the Pyonian government would be interested in learning Zentrum Union’s latest military defence strategy and what they have not been able to achieve. The rest of the boat was a mess. About two dozen people were sitting on the bench, deep in their thoughts, or sleeping on the floor. The sight reminded Viktor of the public ferry he used to take when heading out to a small island for work many years ago. The warm air and sunny sky then made a great contrast to this grim sight before his eyes. He continued to observe the passengers, but it was too dark to see anyone’s face. Despite this, Viktor was saddened to know that one person he was searching for was not on this boat. His wife, Liliya, was suddenly taken in for investigation a month ago without any official explanations. Viktor could only speculate that she uncovered something that was never meant to be found during her job as an internal auditor. After weeks of enquiries, pleading, and pulling strings, it appeared that Liliya Patrov had never existed. Viktor got wind from his colleagues that the officials were probing him and his daughter. The continuous and exhausting worry had abruptly changed into horror and urgency. His colleagues advised him to stay put as they did not commit any crime, but Viktor had already made a decision, despite it was the hardest one he ever made. Abandoning my wife… to save my daughter… The engine continued to hum in the background, complemented by the gentle waves swaying the hull. It had already been three-and-a-half hours since they departed. Viktor was surprised by how much he had lost in his thoughts. We must be there by now. He looked up above the bow of the boat, expecting to see the outline of the hills of Pyon, but instead was met by a sea of dense fog. The fog was thicker than what Viktor was comfortable with. The streetlights were now completely invisible and the freezing air created the atmosphere of a horror film. The guards could be right next to us at any time. For a moment, Viktor wondered if he would have preferred crossing the channel in a thunderstorm or dense fog. He hoped the captain had experience for this weather condition and turned back to search for reassurance. The captain appeared to be a little more nervous, tapping on his steering wheel lightly, but remained emotionless and piloted the boat steadily forward. A louder diesel engine noise approached from the starboard side. The captain swiftly switched off the engine in the hope to remain stealthy in the fog, but it was getting louder and louder by the second. Viktor held Beth even closer and breathed as lightly as he could. Viktor could now hear the waves crashing to the other boat and could only imagine how close it was. Are they going to see us? Viktor prayed that they would simply pass by. His doubt was answered seconds later by a violent shock hitting the boat and threw everyone out from their benches. Freezing water started flooding in and soaked everyone’s ankles. ‘That bastard rammed us!’ proclaimed the captain furiously. Everyone on their own now. Viktor grabbed his daughter’s hand tightly and searched for a life vest with another hand. He could only find one underneath the bench and put it onto Beth without a second thought. A second violent crash hit the boat. Viktor lost his balance and fell onto the flooded floor. The cold was unbearable, but Viktor knew they had to survive and climbed pulled himself up. A searchlight lit up the cabin through the thin fabric canopy and revealed the state of the interior: some people were fighting towards the stern, looking for an exit; some were so scared that they just froze on the spot, but no one appeared to ready to surrender. We won’t either. He piggybacked his frightened five-year-old and stumbled his way to the bow of the boat. As they climbed out from the half-submerged cabin, Viktor could see the cause of the crash. Much to his despair, a Zentrum Union patrol boat lodged its bow on the starboard side of the sinking smuggling boat. The weight of the patrol boat had forced it down into the water and tilted it to one side. Despite the poor visibility, the guards, armed with rifles, were keen to arrest everyone or kill those who resisted. Determined to escape, Viktor grabbed his daughter and jumped into the sub-zero water on the other side, planning to use the sinking hull and the fog as a cover to swim away. Once the Pyon guys found me, Viktor hoped, we are safe. He knows the Pyon border patrols will never turn away the distress instantly, especially those from the Zentrum Union. He grabbed a piece of fibreglass broken off from the hull to aid floatation. ‘We will be fine. Just hold on tight, okay?’ said Viktor to his daughter, who had been trembling from the coldness and the incident. He slowly peddled away from the wreckage. Despite her daughter’s life vest, carrying his daughter in this cold was more exhausting than Viktor had imagined. Driven by the hope of being rescued by the Pyon border patrols, he continued to distance them from the incident site slowly and steadily. Before Viktor realised, both boats had already disappeared completely in the fog. Some screams broke the silence, closely followed by a few gunshots, which startled the poor Beth. A few people must have been fighting till the end, Viktor imagined. He swam a little faster. The shouting and screams had stopped soon after the gunshots. Viktor expected a question from Beth, asking if those people were dead, but it never came. He turned back to Beth, who had her eyes closed and her trembling had stopped. A terrible horror rushed to Viktor’s throat, he immediately shook Beth lightly. ‘Hey Beth… don’t sleep sweetie… don’t sleep… we are almost there… stay with me… ’, Viktor tried to wake his daughter, but to his frustration, he could not speak any louder. She looked at peace in this water as if the crash had not happened. She has to wake, Viktor tried not to think about the worst and slapped her cheeks. He realised his hand was so stiff that it was like a punch. No response. ‘Hey, Beth… Come on! Wake up please sweetie…’ Viktor continued shaking her with occasion slaps on her cheeks, yet her eyes remained stubbornly closed. Viktor wanted to cry, but no tears flowed out. His mind turned blank and it dawned on him that how lost he was, alone in the middle of the foggy sea, stuck between two very different countries. He looked up, the starry night was barely visible. A light cough broke the dreadful silence. Viktor was overjoyed to see his daughter was still with him and it was the best sight he could hope for at this moment. He hugged Beth tightly. ‘Thank god. Beth, you are here. I am so, so sorry for all this…’ said Viktor. ‘It’s okay, daddy’, replied Beth weakly, ‘Please don’t cry daddy…’ Viktor could not believe his daughter was comforting him. ‘Don’t sleep and talk to me okay?’ He reminded her. Beth nodded slowly. Moments later, a boat was approaching. After almost losing Beth, Viktor did not care if they were going to be rescued by the Pyon patrols or captured by the Zentrum Union guards anymore. He just wanted a chance for his daughter to live. He searched for a whistle on Beth’s life vest and quickly found one on the shoulder strap. He blew the whistle as hard as he could, with every ounce of his energy to save both of their lives. The engine noise drew closer. It’s working, Viktor thought, they are coming to get us. Viktor could see the red and green navigation lights from the boat, as it slowly came into view from the fog. Viktor continued to whistle. The boat slowed down a little and a stream of searchlight broke through the fog, slowly closing the distance between them. Viktor grabbed Beth and swam to the side of the approaching boat, readied to be rescued. Viktor could now see the entire boat. It reads Pyon Border Patrol on its hull. Thank god, thought Viktor, we finally make it. The searchlight halted abruptly on Viktor and Beth, ‘Stay where you are. We are going to throw a lifebuoy for you. Hold on to your girl with one hand, grab the lifebuoy with another. We will winch you in.’, said a firm voice from the loudspeaker. A lifebuoy splashed down a few metres away almost instantly. Viktor noticed two men also dived into the water and swam towards them. Viktor complied with the instructions, holding Beth with his left arm and the lifebuoy with his right. The men approached him. ‘Don’t worry, you are safe now. We will make sure your daughter can hold onto you,’ said one of them. ‘Are there any others?’ asked the other. Viktor shook his head, they are probably all in custody or dead now. The winch slowly dragged the exhausted Viktor and Beth to the boat, and four people were already on standby to pull them up. After much struggle, Viktor and Beth were finally sitting on the deck, shaking in the cold wind and dripping water everywhere. Someone passed them reflective blankets and towels. Viktor quickly dried his head and dried Beth properly. They were taken inside a large cabin immediately after. Still shaking uncontrollably from the cold, they were given some dry clothes to change into. Beth was smiling for the first time since leaving the port, a face that Viktor thought he could never see again. He sat Beth down on a sofa nearby and sat right next to her. He sighed in a sense of relief. Two men who rescued them knocked and opened the door, they were tall, well-built, appeared seasoned with many years of service in the sea. They walked in with a friendly smile, seeming glad that they managed to save someone in tonight’s patrol ‘You saved our lives,’ thanked Viktor to the rescue workers, ‘Thank you so, so much.’ ‘Don’t worry about it. It’s our job. We are border patrols after all.’ replied the taller of the two, he had neither a name or ranking on his uniform. ‘You are lucky that we managed to find you in this fog,’ said the other,’ the chances of finding the victim in poor visibility is slim, not to mention we were not doing a search and rescue in the first place.’ A miracle indeed, thought Viktor, imagined that they would be dead by now if there was no whistle on Beth’s life vest. He was handed a cup of coffee, but despite his almost-hyperthermia state, it was too piping hot to drink. As he held the paper cup with both hands, the uncontrollable trembling slowly disappeared. ‘What is your name, mister?’ asked the taller rescuer, who noticed Viktor’s condition appeared to be well enough for the administrative process. Viktor hesitated, wondering if he should hide their true identities until he meets someone from the office who could offer diplomatic protection, but a higher-up official is unlikely to agree with a meeting unless they are aware of who Viktor was and the valuable intelligence he held. Claiming yourself a defector is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. ‘Viktor Patrov,’ revealed Viktor, after processing the limited advantageous options, ‘and this is my daughter Beth Patrov.’ ‘Nice to meet you Beth, Viktor.’ smiled the rescuer. ‘It’s impressive that you still have your bag with you.’ pointed out the other one. Viktor noticed his dripping-wet bag, wondered if the drive survived the water. ‘Well, you know…’ replied Viktor, ‘family photos can’t just be left behind.’ Viktor looked up and was met by a pistol barrel pointing closely to his forehead. His first instinct was to protect Beth. He tried to push Beth away but was immediately held down by the other man. ‘I understand,’ said the man as he loaded a bullet into the chamber, ‘leave no trace, right?’ Viktor tried to get a final glimpse of his daughter, but before his eyes could meet hers, a shot fired and his world turned completely dark."

      "chapterTitle": "Chapter 1 – The New Day",
      "text": "The consistent high-pitch beep of the alarm clock mercilessly pulled Ariel Wilora from his deep slumber, who took a few seconds to locate the snooze button. Without looking, he slapped the button firmly and knocked the digital alarm clock off from the bedside table. Ariel reluctantly opened his eyes and dreaded to accept the least-welcomed sight of any 13-year-old boy: the morning sunlight of the first day of school pierced through the thin nylon curtain and brightened up the bedroom. The day has finally come, Ariel sighed, and what’s the point of waking up this early? Ariel sat up slowly, as he stretched his arms upwards in a dramatic manner, hoping to ease the return to reality. He glanced down to the alarm clock to double-check the time. It was 7 a.m., three whole hours earlier than his routine wake-up time for every day in the last month. An old computer struggling to boot up was akin to Ariel’s state of mind now. He wondered if his dad’s Saturday hangovers felt the same. After stumbling to the bathroom and managing to brush his teeth, he walked back to his room to start packing for school. Except for a poster of a fighter jet, which provided a contrast to the light blue colour of the four walls, the room was simple and modestly tidy. The unmade bed was adjacent to the bedroom door, and the medium-sized desk was tucked at the opposite corner, which sat next to the sliding window and allowed Ariel to admire the familiar sea view. There was not much on the desk except English and Asian History textbooks, which Ariel had used to finish the seemingly endless summer holiday homework the previous night hurriedly. Another item on the desk was Ariel’s most prized possession, the high-performance laptop computer that was last year’s birthday present from his parents and had been an inseparable companion since. Ariel shoved the textbooks into his backpack, and then carefully placed the computer into a separate compartment. Unfortunately, we can’t stay at home today buddy. As Ariel struggled to adjust to the tightness of the school uniform around his shoulder, he made his way downstairs to the living room, which had an open-plan kitchen and a large full-pane window overseeing the same sea view in his bedroom. As usual, the house was quiet this morning. Ariel’s father had started working in the workshop next door before dawn, and his mother had to leave early for the commute to the city. He grabbed the milk and a box of cornflakes and made two bowls of cereal breakfasts. Light footsteps broke the silence of the house. ‘I don’t want to go to school…’ said Kyle, Ariel’s little brother, as he wobbled down the stairs as Ariel did a moment ago. ‘Well, we all have to,’ smiled Ariel, although he felt the same, ‘Come on. Sit down and eat your breakfast.’ With a mouthful of sugary cornflakes, Ariel grabbed the TV remote on the kitchen counter and switched on the television. The morning news was about to move on to the next segment. ‘…the Department of Transport urged people to leave home early as the Melian City Metro is experiencing a technical issue, which caused delays for up to 20 minutes on some lines…’ reported the news lady. This piece of information could not be more irrelevant to their life. Ariel and his brother were born and raised in this seaside town of Pierra, where everyone either worked on a boat, or something related to the boats or brought by the boats. Although by no means a small town, fancy transports like metros or exciting high-rise department stores never appeared in Pierra. The most high-tech thing in this town was probably Ariel’s computer. All in all, life here was as dramatic as watching paint dry. However, Melian City, the capital of Pyon, was fast-becoming one of the most modern metropolis in Asia. Glass-glazed futuristic skyscrapers were being built at an unbelievable speed, with each rising higher than the last. With a population of seven million, the economy was booming with an uncountable number of technology companies and financial cooperation. Unsurprisingly, many left Pierra to chase their dreams in Melian over the years. Ariel heard stories of how they became rich and famous in no time. Strangely, no one told the stories of those who did not make it. ‘Do you want to jam your toast bro?’ asked Kyle, whilst waving the strawberry jam-coated knife. The energetic tone of the question surprised Ariel, whose little brother was too sleepy to have breakfast a minute ago. ‘No, just make your own.’ Ariel replied. He sped up consuming the cornflakes before they became too disgustingly soggy. ‘Last night, the Pyon Border Patrol has successfully rescued 34 migrants. The men and women were found just outside…’ continued the news report, which Ariel was listening to pass the time. ‘I thought you didn’t want to go to school,’ pointed out Ariel, ‘but you seem actually quite excited.’ ‘Well, I still don’t want to go to school,‘ explained Kyle, as he enjoyed his strawberry jam toast, ‘it’s the first day, isn’t it? There aren’t any lessons, so we will probably finish by lunch. Can I go play at Max’s house?’ ‘Ah, oh right. Yes sure.’ replied Ariel. It has only been one year since he left primary school into the dazzling world of secondary school, but the privilege of having half a school day had already been discarded and long forgotten. Especially not with this many club activities going on, thought Ariel. Ariel finished his bowl of cereal quickly and chucked the bowl in the kitchen sink. He then switched the television off and picked up his backpack swiftly. ‘Alright, I am off now. Don’t stay out too late,’ reminded Ariel as he put on his stiff and uncomfortable leather school shoes, ‘we will both get in trouble if you do.’ Kyle gave a thumbs-up, too busy with chewing his toast to reply verbally. Carrying his heavy backpack, Ariel stepped out of the door, exposed to the warm but strong morning sun. The Wilora family house was built on a slope facing the sea. Despite the evaluation of only a few stories, it offered a fantastic view of the sea and a clear view of the main road next to the waterfront. Since Pierra was built along the waterfront and the foothills, half of the town was either on a slope or along twisty mountain roads. The family also owned a medium-sized workshop next door, Ariel’s dad had been working tirelessly on making and repairing small boat hulls for decades. His dad liked to have the wide shutter opened to let fresh air in, and every passer-by could a dozen small boats cramped in that space, but despite the shamble it looked, his dad was one of the first people in Pierra to know how to make and repair fibreglass and carbon-fibre composite boats, which was still considered a very specialised skill locally. As a result, a businessman from Melian City came by a few years ago and gave Ariel’s dad an extremely attractive offer, which he accepted. Now, his dad was working for that man. Ariel waved to his dad, who was busy polishing the hull of a rowing boat. ‘I am going to school now,’ informed Ariel, ‘and Kyle said he is going to Max’s place today.’ ‘Morning, boy,’ greeted dad, who looked up with a surprised expression, ‘do you need to meet someone at school today?’ When’s the last time you looked at the calendar? ‘It’s September, dad. I am going to school for school, so is Kyle.’ ‘Summer holiday does fly by, doesn’t it? Be careful!’ Upon saying goodbye, Ariel adjusted the straps of the backpack and continued walking along the mountain road towards the town centre. The school is on the other side of town, but merely 20 minutes away. Depending on the day, he could either head downslope, walked along the waterfront, and walked back up a small hill to get to school, or take the twisty mountain road, through the busy town centre and arrive at the school rear gate. Ariel decided to choose the latter today, having to go through two slopes on the first school day was too difficult. He looked forward to the nice view ahead once passing the neighbours’ houses and walked a little faster. The roadside viewing point was waiting for Ariel’s arrival quietly. As expected, there was no sign of anyone except a few beer cans. This site was built decades ago and long-forgotten. Although the introductory sign displaying the geographical features had faded and deteriorated under the sun, most of Pierra along the waterfront was still within view. Ariel loved this secret base of his. The town was getting ready for the day. Delivery trucks and vans were passing by one another busily on the main road. Slowly-paced students walked in packs of two or three and filled the typically empty pavements. Shop owners were rolling up their shutter gates and putting out various colour promotional signs, and some coffee shops were already serving customers, who usually were pocket-filled high school students getting their daily doses of caffeine and preparing to show off their takeaway coffee cups in the classroom. Ariel could not imagine that he would ever enjoy the awful bitter taste of the coffee. Although it was still early September, the temperature was mild and pleasant. A few tiny cloud patches were dwelling above, but the blue sky stretched to the horizon, and the visibility was excellent. The mysterious land of Zentrum Union at the very far end was just about observable, a place where, as everybody said, dreams and future go to die, which is why every year hundreds of Zentrum Union people fled to Pyon by any means necessary. Ariel did not buy that nonsense and found that overly dramatic statement exhausting. He remembered discussing this in the class last year, and unsurprisingly his controversial opinion was immediately frowned upon by his classmates and even the teacher, except one of the classmates, Horace Pham, who agreed with him completely. Ariel was excited to find a similar-minded buddy. Driven by the same curiosity and the adventurer spirit, he and his new best friend had already decided to explore Zentrum Union someday. A breeze with a hint of the salty sea interrupted Ariel’s daydream. Right, let’s get going, Ariel hopped down from the viewing deck and continued the commute. He soon found himself at the Pierra town centre, which was defined by a rectangular square and known by the locals as the “Pierra Rectangle”, in which a prominent water fountain occupied the centre, taking up about a quarter of the space and featuring an oddly-shaped dark grey statue in the middle, as if a giant metal hand was melted and installed with a water hose. The statue is surrounded by six evenly-spaced metal pillars within the fountain, as if forming an enclosure to contain the monster in the middle. This post-modern architectural design and layout always amused Ariel slightly, the 1980s futuristic design was obviously out of place compared to the rest of the good old Pierra and appeared someone was desperately trying to modernise or even push the town ahead of its time. Ultimately, the only legacy that remained was this uniquely strange square slowly being taken over by the local shops, a few vendors and wives doing their laundry. How oddly dystopian this turned out to be. Luckily, there was a redeeming quality with the design of the Rectangle: the buildings to the northwest were demolished years ago to make space for a park. Unusually, the green space remained today and everyone could enjoy the same beautiful sea view even standing at the square. Since the sea view was the only thing that Ariel truly likes about his home town, this gap mattered more than anything in the vicinity. In this part of town, the land on the far side seemed to look slightly closer, but Ariel still failed to see anything of interest. The mysterious land was quiet as usual. ‘You interested in that place?’ interjected an old man, who had approached the absent-minded Ariel from behind, ‘They used to be one of us you know.’ Ariel was not impressed by his lousy method to try to start a conversation. As every kid in Pyon learned in the history lesson during secondary school Grade 1, both Pyon and Zentrum Union used to be the same country under British rule for the last century until the British gradual decolonisation 30 years ago. The leaving British formed a new government with a group of enthusiastic local politicians. ‘However, they had soon turned to communism,’ continued the old man, who overlooked Ariel’s impatient expression, ’and the idea of efficient absolute monitoring and control blossomed. Subsequently, the leading party renamed the country to Zentrum Union. As expected, a group of governors responsible for east of the Pyon district rebelled against the idea. Peaceful negotiations never led to any results, but luckily a violent civil war never broke out despite occasion local military conflicts. This colossal River Perryson helped the stagnation of conflict escalation by sitting between us and the Zentrum Union. Eventually, we became an independent country and both sides formed a peace deal to help each other financially.’ Confused and intimated by this sudden history lesson delivered by a stranger, Ariel politely excused himself and dashed to the side of the square to carry on commuting. That was creepy, Ariel thought, do this guy just talk random history to random people? Dover Street was the final stretch of the walk and led directly to the school. Ariel started to see more students wearing the same school uniform joining the road and paced ahead. Some groups were in high spirit, excitedly exchanging what they were up to in the summer, sharing holiday photos. Some boys were busy giving each other a pinch or a smack in the head as greetings. A few older-looking students were skilfully kicking a football with hands in their pockets, which was the coolest pose that one can have by being in the football team. Ariel glanced left. A few boys and girls were walking slowly and stiffly, who were likely the new Grade 1 students being nervous for their first day. So this is what I looked like this time last year, Ariel sighed in a sense of relieve, luckily I am in Grade 2 now. ‘---iel Wilora!!’ shouted a voice from the rear, which was immediately followed by a deafening bicycle brake noise. Even without looking, Ariel knew who the person was instantly, as there was only one guy who would say morning in this dramatic manner. He looked back and saw Chase’s bicycle stopping inches away from his right foot. An out-of-breathe Chase sat on the saddle and slapped Ariel’s shoulder, ‘Good morning Ariel!’ ‘Stop trying to run me over,’ protested Ariel, ‘it won’t be a good morning for me with a scarred ankle!’ ‘I am trying to train your reflexes. All you do is to sit in front of a computer and stare at the monitor all day,’ smiled Chase, as he got off the bicycle, ’your motor skills are close to none. I am doing you a favour by running you over.’ ‘What’s the point of having great reflexes if you put me in a hospital?’ ‘Surely there are things you can try with a broken leg,’ Chase continued, ‘anyway, come on. Let’s get going.’ Chase Lyn was in the same Grade 1 class as Ariel and the Computing Club as well. Naturally, it did not take long for him to start calling Ariel ‘buddy’, but apart from sharing the same class and school club, he was the polar opposite of Ariel. With a smile never leaving his face, he seemed to be friends with everyone in the class and the club and everybody knew him at school. Chase was also one of the few Grade 1 students who got involved with two school clubs. They often said that he was one of the best junior rowers the school had ever seen. Although being occasional mischievous like that close-call with his bicycle, Chase always stepped in when someone got in a fight or lent a hand to anyone asking for help as well. For many people, including Ariel, that Chase was flawlessly popular and good at absolutely everything, but his radiating popular personality was too intimating to bear. Sometimes, Ariel wondered if Chase would get tired from all the attention and social interactions. The five-storey classroom building came into view, which sat left to the main school gate. The gate took up the entire width of Dover Street and the public road continued with a junction on the right going downslope. The other end of that road was the waterfront with an array of rowing club clubhouses and boat workshops. Ariel heard that the school rowing club had a base down there as well, but he never cared enough to walk there in person. Another group of students were walking up the road and joined the rest of the cohort through the school gate. Despite the ordinary design of the entrance, it bore one of the proudest names in this town: Central Pierra Secondary School. Although the school was not at the centre of Pierra geographically, it had been the centre of attention of countless parents and teachers with the consistent excellent academic performance, and outstanding school clubs activities. Since it was not a fee-paying school, admission was fair and square. However, good education often came with good financial support. Last year, Ariel found out most students in CPSS came from a middle-class or even richer family by just talking to the classmates. The school building was gigantic compared to most schools in Pyon. The Pierra Town Council decided it would be too uneconomical to build separate middle schools and high schools with such a low population, and combined middle schools and high schools to form a single secondary school instead. However, the rest of Pyon still had separate middle schools and high schools. In order words, Central Pierra Secondary School was twice as large as most Pyonian schools. Ariel, like many others, enjoyed the integrated secondary school concept because it saved the hassle of choosing a new school. However, it did entail the risk of being with your enemies for six years straight. Ariel anxiously hoped he would not end up that annoying guy in the same class this year. Ariel and Chase moved with the crowd slowly and found themselves at the sports ground. The sports ground was surrounded by the classroom building, the multi-purpose teaching building and the gymnasium, with one side facing River Perryson through a flimsy weaved metal fence. The sports ground was the centrepiece of the school, but it was nothing more than a dirt pitch and some faded white paint outlining several basketball courts and a football field. Today, they had put up some announcement boards for the students. For some reason, the school had a good idea of scrambling classes every year. On the first school day, each student would be randomly assigned to one of the five classes ‘to make more friends’ and ‘learn to adapt in different social groups’, as the school explained proudly on its website. The whole policy became a bit of a double-edged sword. You could lose your enemy just as easily you lose friends after spending only one year at a time. ‘Grade 2… Grade 2…’ Chase murmured, as he and Ariel were struggling to find the announcement boards for Grade 2 classroom allocation, ‘ah! They are over there Ariel.’ Chase pointed to the far end towards the gymnasium. Ariel stood on his toes in an attempt to get a line of sight above the sea of fellow confused schoolmates. Why didn’t they simply put these up in ascending order? How hard can that be? Another crowd gathered in front of the five boards. Some were tip-toeing to get a better view; some grabbed their friends’ shoulders as support to leap up as if they could search the long lists in that short burst of supported jump; the smart ones simply asked their keen classmates to help them look while standing away from the chaos. Ariel recognised some of the faces from last year, but his best friend Horace was not among them. ‘Hey, Ariel! Found your name there,’ Chase waved and pointed at the second board from the left, ‘Wow you at the very bottom! Seems you are in 2B now. The class number is… 38.’ Chase’s announcement had interrupted the search, his helpfulness and a sharp eye for names still impressed Ariel. However, his last unfortunate remark deflated Ariel a little. They can’t deal with ascending order announcement boards, but never fails to number us alphabetically! ‘Thanks, Chase,’ Ariel smiled forcefully, ‘I always get the bottom of the list because of my last name, you know? “W” doesn’t exactly have many alphabets come after-‘ ‘-and I am in class 2A! Oh, this is gonna be fun! I’ve Mr Tang as my class teacher! Everyone said ’, said Chase excitedly, ignoring Ariel, whose forced smile froze instantly. ‘…well I guess we are not in the same class this year then.’ Ariel pointed out, remembering Chase was one of the most popular and sociable students. ‘I guess not,’ said Chase, who had settled down a little, ‘see you at the Computing Club then. You are going today, right?’ ‘Of course, are you?’ ‘Yeah, why would I miss it?’ replied Chase, as he turned around and someone caught his attention, ‘I gotta run, see you in a bit!’ Chase quickly jogged to meet his friends and gave them a tackle. As the group disappeared among the arriving students, Ariel glanced back at the 2B board to check who was going to be the class teacher. Luckily, it was Miss Swanson, a nice lady who had been teaching in this school for 30 years, gaining the utmost respect with her teaching experience and approachable personality. The school bell rang, which came in the form of the famous Westminster Quarters melody. The term opening ceremony was about to begin. Eager to escape from the rising sun and its increasingly brutal heat, Ariel swiftly joined the crowd to walk into the Gymnasium. The refreshing chilly air-conditioned air complemented the redecorated interior of the Gymnasium. Seats were arranged neatly in rows and separated by a path in the middle, facing directly straight ahead to a temporary stage, which had a standalone wired microphone at the centre. As Ariel stumbled along the path within the swarms of people, he frantically scanned the signs on left and right. Every student needed to sit with their new class for the first school assembly before proceeding to the classroom. However, the ‘2B’ sign seemed to take forever to find. 1C… 1D…1E… 4C… 4D… 4E… 2A… 2...B! It turned out most students had taken their seats within the class 2B zone already. A few boys and girls who knew each other before chatted enthusiastically, whilst the rest sat in silence awkwardly and waited for the assembly to begin. Ariel squeezed through two guys and sat down. Finally! I can catch my breath now! With miraculous timing, the lights dimmed in seconds with a few beams focused on the main stage. Ariel tried to look around to find familiar faces but struggled to see them in the dark. He decided to do that later and turned his attention back to the stage. The Deputy Principal, Mr Hong, walked up the stage and halted his position firmly before the microphone. He was a tall man wearing a pair of thin glasses. He looked at the students sternly, almost like an angry tiger looking for its prey. ‘Woah, he seems pretty scary…’ whispered the girl at the front. ‘Shush… you will get us in trouble…’ hushed the other girl. His expression had successfully quieted the majority of chatter in less than ten seconds. Ariel remembered very little about him from last year, but he appeared more threatening than before for some reason. ‘Good morning. Welcome back, boys and girls, and my fellow colleagues,’ said the Deputy Principal, ‘before we move on, I have an announcement to make.’"

      "text": "All eyes were on Mr Hong now. Ariel was not quite sure how to react to the announcement concerning the departure of Mr Larkin, who was the school principal that was loved by absolutely everyone. He was a slightly chubby man with a few grey hair and thin spectacles, often walked with hands held behind his back and a smile on his face. The legend was that in Mr Larkin’s thirty-odd years in this school, he never failed to show up at the school gate in the morning to greet students even once. Although Ariel had only been in this school for over a year, Mr Larkin always somehow remembered his name, like how he remembered everyone else’s name. Ariel did not only admire his brilliant memory but respected him because he was respecting everyone. Just before the summer holiday, Mr Larkin was excitedly telling all the students the activities and school trips he had planned for next year, and now he had just resigned ‘for personal reasons’. Mr Hong cleared his throat, glanced across hundreds of confused faces and continued, ‘I am sure this is somewhat shocking and unsettling to you all. Rest assured that the members of staff and I are doing our best to handle the transition.’ The crowd did not sound assured, the whispering grew louder by the second. Why did Mr Larkin leave… What’s going to happen now… I heard that Mr Larkin was fired… I think Mr Hong is becoming principal now… No students could imagine anyone could replace the much-loved Mr Larkin as the Principal. ‘In the meantime,’ Mr Hong raised his voice, attempting to have everyone’s attention again, ‘may I introduce Mrs Kim as the interim Principal. She had been teaching in a Melian City high school for the last ten years. I am pleased to have Mrs Kim on board and I am sure she will lead the school fantastically. Please offer her our warmest welcome.’ The Deputy Principal took three steps back and began applauding, the students followed instinctively. An unusual way to start a new year, Ariel thought. An average-height woman dressed in an expensive-looking smart suit appeared under the spotlights. She looked like to be in her thirties - extremely young for such an important job. She shook hands with Mr Hong and smiled politely, and walked up to the microphone, maintaining her smile all the way through. Her long straight hair got in the way a little, so she brushed it away lightly, composing herself properly before speaking. ‘Thank you for the kind introduction, Mr Hong,’ she nodded to the Deputy Principal, as if the handshake earlier was not polite enough, ‘good morning boys and girls. My name is Mrs Kim, as Mr Hong said earlier I will be taking up the role as the temporary Principal. However, it doesn’t mean that I will shy away from my duties as the Principal. Please come to meet me, talk to me anytime if you need help.’ Mrs Kim paused for a second, was she trying to look for signs that the students became more relaxed? ‘I know that Mr Larkin had been the role model for everyone and loved by all students and staff, so I apologise in advance if you think I am not as good as Mr Larkin.’ Mrs Kim continued. ‘I am also a student when it comes to the way things work here, so I look forward to meeting and knowing you all! Thank you.’ with that final friendly remark, Mrs Kim took a step back and nodded to the audience, who responded with a wave of powerful applaud, seemingly they had already approved the newcomer. Ariel casually clapped a few, because he disagreed with the response everyone was giving. The woman looked professional, sounded friendly, but it was still too early to see what kind of principal she would turn out to be. Unlike Melian City, the principals in every school in Pierra tend to be more involved with the day-to-day life of the students and their activities. A principal that does not teach classes would be considered an alien behaviour. Sometimes, they might even lead school clubs. Ariel heard from mum that in Melian City, principals were merely a manager for the school, a face to appear before the students and on marketing materials, but in reality, made very little direct contribution to the teaching or students life. Completely different from how things work in Pierra. After learning this strange tale over dinner, Ariel was always under the impression that the lack of social affairs or dense population had freed up every principal to be as down-to-earth as anyone could imagine. ‘…all student clubs can start today after school. Grade 1 students, your class teacher will tell you how to join one soon. Alright, that has concluded our morning assembly. Dismiss!’ Mr Hong concluded the assembly and continued giving instructions to each class to depart. Well, at least the assembly was short. Normally, meeting new people and making friends were not Ariel’s interest, but he was anxious to find out what sort of people he needed to spend this year with. The crowd burst with chatter, people were facing backwards or leaning over each other to exchange gossips and opinions with their friends. The cautious girls in front who hushed each other earlier also took this opportunity. ‘I think she doesn’t seem too bad. I was expecting her to be scary and like shouting at people – the city people usually do, I saw that on that show.’ ‘She looks so cool in that suit! She probably was some successful professional woman in Melian. Do you think she is rich too?’ ‘Probably! Let’s go talk to her, she might even buy us lunch!’ The mart appearance was the most important factor after all, the girls had already thrown their cautious attitude out of the window and considered the new temporary principal their new best friend. Ariel was unimpressed by their lack of strategic and careful consideration, one must stay back and observe properly first! With a light tap on the right shoulder, a curious Ariel turned around to Vito Lanker’s smug face. ‘Hey, Wilora. Nice to see we are in the same class. You had a great summer? What did you do?’ said Vito with a wicked smile, both his eyes and the tone suggested it was a lure to show off how much better his summer was. ‘Oh well you know… sleep, play games, hang out with friends… the usual stuff.’ ‘Umm. Better than nothing I guess, so you spent your days staring at your computer then?’ ‘More or less, and you?’ asked Ariel. He decided to let Vito show off his summer and get him off his back for the rest of the day. ‘Well, my summer holiday was alright. I went on a three-day camping trip with Ken, Skit, Maria and Rachael. Man, it was fun,’ said Vito proudly as he pulled out his flip phone, showing the holiday photos. Ariel could not care less but decided to endure this obnoxious show-off, perhaps he would bug someone else afterwards. ‘…then I went to Tokyo with my family, The Busters was having a world tour concert,’ continued Vito excitedly. The photo album was stuffed with his holiday snapshots, he managed to scroll through the concert pictures just when he was bragging about the concert. Ariel was curious if he had practised his show-off route the night before. ‘That all looked very nice, good for you.’ Ariel replied casually. ‘Better than hugging a monitor,’ sneered Vito, ‘for me that is.’ ‘What do you think of that lady?’ Ariel interrupted, nodded to the direction of the stage, where Mrs Kim was discussing something with Mr Hong. Vito halted his attempted insult, trying to identify the person in question through the crowd of students. ‘Oh, Mrs Kim? My dad knows her I think, she used to be the Head Teacher for Thomson’s High and Melian City Central High before, for eleven years I think.’ Vito said. ‘Yeah, but what do you think of her? Will she be as good as Mr Larkin?’ ‘You don’t know me very well do you? I don’t really give a damn if they get out of my way.’ Vito replied, looking slightly annoyed. Good, he won’t bother me if he’s annoyed at him, thought Ariel, interestingly, I might have the same philosophy. ‘-but, I don’t like her. I think she will be trouble.’ Vito said suddenly with a serious voice. Ariel had never seen a serious-looking Vito before and was surprised that he answered the question in the end. He was even more surprised to find himself agreeing with Vito. Although she had only been introduced for ten minutes, she proved herself to be very competent with that level of experience, despite the young age. Yet she did not come across even confident on the stage. Is she trying to hide something? Half an hour later, Ariel arrived at the 2B classroom along with thirty-odd classmates. He was the last to walk into the classroom, because his class number was last. Every time. Any day with any sort of significance seems to always come with good news and bad news. The bad news was, being in the same class as Vito, losing Mr Hong as the School Principal and having a strange new lady instead. Luckily, the bad news was balanced out with an equal number of good news. The first and the most important nice surprise was the great seat assignment. The perfection position of the window seat in the middle of the row allowed occasion and distracted glance to the view over the sports ground and the River Perryson whenever Ariel felt bored. The middle position provided just enough buffer between him and the teacher to avoid unwanted attention, but not so much that he would struggle to see the blackboard. The sunlight would also warm him up during winter times. Ariel doubted the ancient air-conditioners even had a heating function. Ariel hung his backpack on the metal hook next to the desk, and sat down slowly to savour the joy of getting a perfect position. He could finally continue the habit of staring out at the waterfront from home to school, whilst in class too! To top it off, the desk looked and felt brand-new, not a single scratch on it or months-old chewed gums underneath. This school actually upgrades its facilities! The classmates found their seats one by one after getting the desk number slip from Miss Swanson, the class teacher. Ariel carefully examined each classmate, attempting to find someone he knew. There was too little time to check the list back on the sports ground. Unfortunately apart from two girls that he recognised, and Vito and his gang, every face was unfamiliar. Ariel sighed, it seems that I need to spend some effort to make friends again this year… ‘Have we all found our seat? Wait, hold on, there’s one more slip here,’ Miss Swanson picked up a card and examined it confusedly, ‘umm… Horace Pham? Are you here?’ Ariel secretly rejoiced when he heard his best friend’s name, which undoubtedly was the second piece of good news. The beginning of the school term would not be so lonely after all. However, as the teacher called for his name for the third time, Ariel became slightly worried that Horace was not supposed to be in this class. Suddenly, the door slammed open. Everyone turned their attention to the door, a boy with messy hair and wrinkled shirt hurried in, still catching his breath. ‘Sorry, ma’am… My little brother hid my shirts under his bed… took me half an hour to find them!’ apologised Horace, laughing embarrassedly. ‘Okay… you came in at just the right time, I was about to look for you with the school office. I suppose you are Horace Pham then?’ said Miss Swanson with suspicion. ‘Yes ma’am.’ ‘Here’s your seat number, take your seat and tidy up yourself.’ Horace walked to his seat with the whole class looking at him curiously like a parliament of owls, a few chuckles and gossips sounded from the far end. Ariel was humoured by his dramatic entrance, he was quite glad to see Horace was the same old Horace. He took the empty seat next to Ariel, and collapsed on the desk, exhausted from the sprint to reach this second-floor classroom. Miss Swanson began her introduction at once. ‘Good morning everybody, my name is Miss Swanson. I will be your class teacher for this coming school year, so I will be seeing all of you quite a lot. If you need anything or want to have a chat, feel free to find me after the homeroom class or call me in the staff room,’ said Miss Swanson with a warm smile, she did not seem to mind Horace’s lateness at all. Mr Hong’s face would be as red as a Royal Gala apple by now. ‘We don’t have any lessons today,’ the teacher said, someone’s cheer made the class laughed, and Miss Swanson smiled together and continued, ‘but we have some work to sort out. First thing first, the Class Committee…’ Ariel used the window of appointing the committee members to catch up with Horace, ‘Hey, you don’t have a little brother,’ said Ariel, ‘or any siblings. That was an unusual excuse that you came up.’ ‘I thought that up when I was running upstairs,’ replied Horace, ‘curtesy to your little brother. I took inspiration from him.’ ‘But he never hid my…’ ‘Remember that time in July when I came over? We spent hours looking for your new game. Turned out your brother hid it behind the wardrobe,’ Horace said, pointing at his shirt proudly, ‘my story matches my shirt too.’ ‘You need to get some batteries for your alarm clock.’ ‘Less not dwell on the details, but yeah let’s go to a supermarket after school.’ Ariel doubted he would leave school early enough today to accompany Horace, who never quite understood Ariel’s dedication to the Computing Club. He would be easily come across as a ‘naughty’ and ‘lazy’ student, especially after being late on the first day, but Ariel knew Horace since primary school, and he was very smart indeed. Nearly coming first in every test and always coming in top five in the whole year of Grade 1, Horace was as academically gifted as anyone could hope for. Before Ariel noticed, it was already time for the morning 15-minute recess. The long-waited freedom finally came with the sweet school chime. The class immediately exploded with chatter. Ariel decided to stretch his legs by getting a drink from the canteen vending machine. It had been a while since there were so many people around. Although Ariel did not mind being around in large groups, the restless chit-chats and gossips were exhausting to keep up. He leaned against the metal railings and took a sip from the cold grape fizzy drink. The light breeze felt so nice in the summer sun. A black van drove in through the gate and parked next to the bicycle shed. Two workers got out with their toolboxes. The new principal walked steadily towards the van and greeted them. The principal is meeting the technicians personally? She led the men towards the back of the building and disappeared. They were carrying basic hand tools, so surely it was not a big repair job, maybe she needed to fix something in her office – Mr Larkin’s old office – really badly? Still, it was quite odd that she came to them, was it yet another strange habit of the Median City folks? By lunchtime, Ariel had already forgotten about the van and Mrs Kim. Miss Swanson managed to finish all the first-day paperwork and giving the keen students the roles of ‘Class Committee’ as well, which Ariel thought was a waste of time and effort. When the chime sounded, the newly appointed Class Lead gave his first order. ‘All stand!’ Everyone stood up almost completely in synchrony with hands behind their backs. ‘Bow!’ Everyone bent their backs forward, albeit not so neatly this time. ‘Goodbye Miss Swanson.’ said every student robotically. The same routine had been repeated at the end of each class for as long as Ariel could remember. ‘See you all tomorrow.’ Miss Swanson waved to the class and walked out with a smile. With this approval, the whole class once again exploded with chatter. Everyone appeared to have made friends already, groups of three or four gathered and happily exchanging ideas for restaurants to go for lunch. However, for most students at Central Pierra Secondary School, the day was far from over. Although there would be an official Club Festival for every school club to show off and recruit members, every experienced club knew that the first day was more crucial to recruit new members to get their reputation out there, and to plan the activities or train for competitions for the year ahead. After all, nearly every Central Pierra school club was pretty much unmatched in the whole country in their field. Living up to that reputation takes effort and teamwork, and luckily, most students were enthusiastic enough to work hard. Ariel did not look it, but he had been keen to push for the first win for the Computing Club at the National Hackathon. The competition rules said every school could enter a piece of a pre-made program, but each team would then have 24-hours to enhance it on site after getting the secret instructions. Ariel had been putting his blood and sweats in it all summer, and today he needed more people to help him, before the seniors snatched the defenceless Grade-1 kids away. ‘A weather forecast app?’ doubted Chase, as he looked through the prototype program shown off by Ariel, who just hurried into the computer room. ‘Sorry Ariel, that stuff has already been invented.’ ‘No… no… no… mine’s different,’ defended Ariel, realising how powerless his words were as soon as they leave his mouth. Chase looked more unconvinced. ‘I could pinpoint exactly when and where the sun comes out, rains or snows,’ continued Ariel, pointing at the screen to show the app’s amazing functionalities, ‘so if you install this on your phone, or laptop, you know how the weather is going change at where you are standing at exactly which second.’ Chase remained silent, he touched his chin lightly with his thumb, staring at the computer screen. He was like a completely different person when discussing matters like this. ‘I have three questions,’ Chase broke the silence, ‘One, did they allow each school to submit different ideas? Two, how accurate is your prediction?’ he paused for a second, ‘Three, where did you get the past weather data from? They don’t put that mountain of data online, surely.’ ‘One, oddly yes, apparently they look at what each school sends it and tailor a challenge for them on the spot. This is one of the reasons why I am here today, getting the Grade 1 new joiners. Two, it is very accurate. I can let you try,’ replied Ariel. Before he answered the last question, he made sure no one was paying attention to them. ‘Finally, I got the data from Horace’s dad.’ ‘Horace’s dad? Doesn’t he work in the Immigration Office or something?’ ‘In the Foreign Office I think, but he has some friends in the National Observatory and trusted me with the data.’ Ariel had always wanted to let someone know he was part of a trusted secret. This must have impressed Chase. ‘Woah… that’s actually so cool,’ admired Chase, looking quite impressed, ‘but isn’t that kinda cheating?’ ‘No one said you cannot rely on friends and family,’ said Ariel as he picked up his laptop, preparing to impress and recruit several Grade 1 students who just stumbled in, ‘but don’t tell anyone okay? They might send the police after me.’ ‘Okay… but I don’t think they will hunt you down for reporting weather …’ Timing is key. Grade 5 senior student Colin also noticed the two new guys walking in, and he was closer to them too. His eyes brightened up and immediately walked towards them. Ariel must not let him get to them first, he held on to his computer and left Chase behind, almost jogged to intercept them. The students soon realised they were being approached by two predators, but were too shocked to move an inch. Ariel and Colin made it to the kids at the same time. ‘WELCOME TO THE COMPUTING CLUB!’ said both of them together at the same time, trying to hide their true intention of recruiting the confused new students into their projects. ‘Ehh…’ stammered one of the Grade 1s timidly, ‘we… we… would like t-to… ch-ch-check out t-the club…’ ‘YOU ARE AT THE RIGHT PLACE!’ responded Colin happily, putting his arm around his shoulder, ‘we gather here almost every school days to write programs, work on our projects. Sometimes we work on electronic projects and robots too. You see there are about thirty of us, but you will be among the best minds in this school. Come see what I have been up to, I will introduce you to the others too!’ They were too scared and polite to refuse, but this could be a great chance to step in. ‘Umm, Colin? Perhaps they might want to chat with someone that is… closer in age?’ proposed Ariel as gently as he could, which Colin turned back and stared, ‘you know this is their first day, and such a senior and experienced club member like yourself, could be… intimidating?’ Colin stopped to think, and suddenly let go of the poor Grade 1 kid. ‘You have a point, show them what you did Ariel,’ said Colin, and subtly mouthed the rest of his instructions, get them to join us! Ariel sat them down at the closest desk, and put his computer in the middle so they could get a clear view of the masterpiece he was about to display. Eager to impress them, Ariel opened the prototype program at an unprecedented speed. ‘Let me show you what we do here in the Central Pierra Computing Club,’ he announced, then paused for a second before continuing, ‘and this is my masterpiece.’ Several curious club members gathered around as well, Ariel could feel the crowd building up behind them. He pressed the F9 key to run the code. The program popped up as expected, but it was empty, with only a spinning loading icon. Ariel’s heart skipped a beat, he tried again, Reload. Nothing happened. Ariel dared not to look at the confused Grade 1 spectators, or the disappointed eyes behind him penetrating his back like lasers. It had been working perfectly for the last couple of week. I just needed more polishing, why does it always go wrong when you need it the most? Ariel frantically considered his options, but when the first yawn of the Grade 1 kid reached Ariel’s ears, he knew he lost the battle of recruiting the new folks. This could cost the win for the National Hackathon. ‘Well, well, well,’ Colin, who had been watching in the back, sneered at Ariel, ‘I am sure that broken piece of crap could win for us, eh?’ ‘Alright, the show’s over.’ Chase stepped in, dispersing the crowd. He turned to the confused Grade 1 visitors, ‘Sorry, it’s not usually like this here. I think everyone’s a little tense today, it’s the first day back after the long summer holiday after all. I have seen Ariel’s program last week, it is really impressive. It was probably some random error, shame that we can’t demonstrate it today.’ They nodded in response, but did not speak, still uncomfortable with the confrontation earlier. ‘I hope you could still consider us,’ smiled Chase, ‘we could really use some help and fresh minds are always welcome here. We will make sure you get it Ariel’s stuff at the Club Festival.’ Looking more at ease, the visitors left the room with nothing more than a club promotional leaflet that Chase gave them. ‘You didn’t see my program last week,’ said Ariel, ‘you saw it today for the first time. You never saw it work either, why did you lie for me?’ ‘Why do I need a reason?’ replied Chase, taking a seat next to Ariel, ‘we wanted those guys to join us, and I know you definitely had it working, you don’t lie about these things.’ The screen remained stubbornly blank with an endlessly spinning loading icon. It was trying to get the unobtainable weather data, but it was not a problem with the internet connection. Ariel had tried checking his email inbox and it worked fine. The only thing that malfunctioned was Ariel’s creation that he spent many days and nights perfecting. As a perfectionist who prided on writing programs, embarrassment was an understatement. The door opened again, but it was not more curious new students. Instead, Mrs Kim showed up, her flawlessly-ironed smart suit was as distinctive as ever. She walked in slowly, whose signature smile seemed to have glued to her face since this morning. Several senior students stood up from their chairs, Ariel and Chase followed. ‘Good afternoon Mrs Kim!’ said everyone. Growing up in Pyon, formal greetings to teachers like this were something Ariel used to, but he still could not help thinking it was quite unnecessary. ‘Good afternoon everyone,’ said Mrs Kim warmly, looking around, ‘I presume this is the Computing Club that I heard so much about?’ ‘Yes we are it, ma’am,’ Colin jumped at the first chance, ‘we gather here every school days to, work on our projects. Sometimes we do -’ ‘All very well,’ she interrupted him, ‘I am checking out the school clubs that we are having. Everyone is very busy with their clubs even on the first day!’ ‘Yes, indeed. Everyone is quite keen to meet their friends after the summer holiday and do what they love. Every year is a busy year for every clu-’ ‘Excellent. By the way, do you know Ariel Wilora?’ Mrs Kim asked suddenly. The entire club was caught by surprise and turned their heads towards Ariel. Ariel forgot about his program for a moment, and looked for the reason why the new ‘temporary’ Principal would know his name in his head, but could not find one. He put his hand up. ‘Ah right, so you are Ariel?’ said Mrs Kim, walking towards him, ‘which class are you in?’ ‘Ehh… class…2B,’ replied Ariel, ‘am I in trouble?’ ‘What are you working on?’ she bowed down slightly to look at Ariel’s computer screen. ‘Umm… it’s a weather app.’ ‘And is it not working?’ Ariel could not believe the conversation he was having. Really? The second time in a row? Announcing to the world how my program doesn’t work? ‘It worked perfectly fine, I’ve trie-‘ ‘I know why it does not work,’ smiled Mrs Kim, ‘you are not allowed to access government servers from the school servers.’ Ariel had never heard of that rule, almost everyone needed to connect to the government servers at some point to look for information, not just for club projects, but for homework too. Suddenly, the image of that black van driving in the school that he saw earlier flashed through his mind. Did she call someone in to change the school servers on her first day? ‘Why not?’ asked Ariel, trying to stay calm as much as possible. ‘I don’t know how things work here, but we don’t want the school to get in trouble do we?’ ‘But there are loads of things we need, we can’t even –‘ ‘No buts. I will let you off the hook on the first day, but don’t try that again.’ With that warning, Mrs Kim looked satisfied and showed herself out of the room. The Computing Club lost its usual enthusiasm, with only empathetic eyes on Ariel. That night, shortly after dinner, Ariel was lying on his bed staring at his ceilings, going through what happened on this strange day. He took a look at his computer on the desk, with his weather app working perfectly. Despite the mystery of the cause of embarrassing himself in the clubroom was eventually solved with Mrs Kim’s warning, it nevertheless raised more questions than it answered. Ariel tucked himself in under the sheet, determined to find out what does the woman want."

      "text": "Several weeks went by after Ariel’s failed attempt to impress others with his demonstration. No matter how hard Ariel protested, Mrs Kim refused to allow him to show a working program even once. In this time, the school had gotten used to its new leader. Mrs Kim was staggeringly resourceful, and had been offering endless new equipment to the sports teams ‘after seeing how run-down their stuff was’. Most students liked her being around and talking to them too. Her predecessor poor old Mr Larkin was already forgotten in a matter of weeks. Despite the awful first encounter, Ariel found it difficult to hate her too much. She had been as friendly and charming as Mr Larkin. He was only frustrated at the new strange rules. Unsurprisingly, that frustration was also shared by a small group of other clubs too. Astronomy Club, for example, could no longer pinpoint the brightest moment of Venus because they could not get that data from the National Observatory via the school network. Unfortunately, only the nerdiest clubs like Astronomy and Computing Clubs got these problems, so the voices often went unheard by the others. Even Colin started to get worried that Mrs Kim was just getting started with her unreasonable rules. ‘But that’s not something you should be worry about now,’ said Horace, sitting on Ariel’s classroom desk. ‘Wait, what do you mean?’ ‘Just look, what are you doing now?’ Ariel stared at Horace confusedly. He then looked around the classroom, the usual few faces chatting a few rows away, sounded like the new gaming centre was the next destination; the usual 4 pm sunlight breaking through the curtains like arrows, dimly lit up the smudgy blackboard with a few mathematic equations; and the stupid program in front of him that still would not work. ‘What are you talking about? I am doing the same thing that I have been doing, ‘said Ariel, looking for answers. Horace’s eyes were strongly suggesting that Ariel missed something obvious. ‘Did you mean I shouldn’t use the school Wi-Fi? But I can’t afford –‘ ‘THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT!’ proclaimed Horace loudly, covering his forehead with his palm, as if he just saw something traumatic for life. A few people lifted their heads to look at them disapprovingly. At least the school has just finished. ‘Stop being so loud,’ hushed Ariel embarrassedly, ‘and what exactly are you talking about? Get to the point man.’ ‘I know how much you want to win the National Hackathon,’ sighed Horace, ‘but you have been working day-and-night like a power plant. And you are doing this alone too. Where is your social life? You need to meet more people, don’t close yourself to the world like you are in prison!’ ‘Well, I did try to get those Grade 1s, if it wasn’t for that stupid –‘ ‘The only stupid thing here is you are destroying your social life bit by bit. It’s frightening to see how much you focus in your own world.’ Horace insisted, ‘you should swing by my club, I can introduce you to a bunch of new people.’ ‘I think I am good thank you,’ said Ariel, packing up his computer and preparing to leave for the Computing Club again, ‘besides, I want to finish my work first. I might have found a way to get around the issue now. National Hackathon should be in the bag now.’ ‘Alright, see you tomorrow.’ After traversing this route nearly every day for over a year, Ariel could remember every step in this hallway by heart. Twenty seconds in this direction… small dip on the floor near the Class 2E… ten steps up the stairs… nice sea breeze through the window… Although the layout of the classroom building was still boringly the same, it was given an unbelievable transformation after school. Each club takes up at least one room as their base and all sorts of flashy colourful banners, posters and decorations were hung up outside their rooms. The original dull hallway looked like a busy Christmas market at first glance, only with the sounds of singing, laughing, music, or movies flooding the whole school. It was a paradise for someone looking for a full and rich school life, even for someone like Ariel, who was not interested in meeting or being with people. The Band Club’s mix of guitar, bass, drums and keyboard sounded better and louder by the day, a clear result of their relentless rehearsals, but Ariel had no time to enjoy the latest performance. He walked past the music room and arrived at the IT room. Next to the robots and computer parts being displayed, a boy was standing quietly in front of the door, but had no intention to open it. Ariel took a few moments to recognise him, it was the boy on the first day who visited Computing Club with his friend, but he was alone today. He tapped on the boy’s shoulder and smiled, inviting him to come in. The boy still looked nervous. No one took a second look at them when Ariel was looking for a place to sit down and get on with his project, but when Colin noticed the new blood and shouted the most dramatic welcome, the whole room blew up. Everyone came to the boy and offered their warm welcomes. The Grade 1 boy thanked them repeatedly. Someone asked him if he decided to join, then he said yes. Everyone cheered again like they just won the lottery. Colin stepped in and asked, ‘what’s your name?’ ‘Pavel…’ answered the boy. ‘Great to have you Pavel,’ said Colin satisfyingly, ‘where’s your friend from last time?’ ‘Umm, he joined the Badminton Club instead.’ ‘Not to worry, but tell your friend that everyone can join more than one club,’ Colin patted his shoulder, and looked to Ariel, ‘are you going to give our latest generation a thorough introduction?’ Ariel nodded. He could not believe his luck, the help he desperately needed for the hackathon just turned up at the front door! He showed Pavel his program from last time and explained why he needed more help to rewrite the code to get around the issue. The school still would not allow connection to the government servers. Despite a rather intimidating start, Pavel seemed to be paying attention the whole time, with occasional nods and smiles. Then, Pavel brought out his computer to show his creation ‘back in primary school’ by himself, which was a quite sophisticated first-person shooting game with lovely graphics and unbelievably good sound effects, comparable to what was being sold at the town centre game shop. Several guys from Grade 4 were watching Pavel’s game in awe. Nobody expected how good this new Grade 1 boy was. Ariel was pleasantly surprised too. Perhaps the only wall that stood between the National Hackathon trophy and the school was Pavel’s shyness. Ariel chatted with Pavel for hours. Ariel had the best evening he had had in several months, just brainstorming with another brilliant programmer got his blood flowing and ideas exploding like fireworks in his head. Before he realised it, it was already past eight and most people were already gone. At the school gate, Ariel said goodbye to his new best friend, who certainly seemed a lot more cheerful than several hours ago or several weeks ago. Ariel was too hungry to walk home, so he called Kyle to start eating without him. He made his way down the hilly path towards the waterfront, where rowing clubhouses and workshops took up almost every space facing the river, except for one important establishment. Lyn’s Noodle Bar lit up its lights like a beacon for Ariel and his empty stomach. Locating just a few minutes’ walk from the Central Pierra Rowing Club clubhouse, the restaurant looked ordinary – it took up the ground floor space of a two-storey concrete house, with a sliding door front entrance and a faded takeaway menu stuck to an oily window next to the door, but it was always a vital sanctuary for students to refuel, to hang out, to study, even to escape detentions if you know the right person. Ariel was a little surprised by how busy the restaurant was on this Tuesday evening, but he managed to squeeze through the customers and find a seat at the bar. Just behind the counter, the chef was tirelessly making stir fry. Ariel could not take his eyes off from the diced chicken and onions being seasoned and scoped around on the wok. His stomach reminded him again that dinner must be served imminently. ‘So, what can I get you?’ asked Chase with a wicked smile, wearing a stained apron and leaning on the countertop. ‘You know, the usual one, Chase,’ replied Ariel, ‘and make it an urgent order, I am dying of hunger here.’ ‘You got it, man,’ Chase turned around to the chef, ‘dad! One medium chicken ramen with plenty of seaweed, no spice!’ ‘Alright!!’ said the chef, finishing off the stir fry. ‘So,’ Chase turned to Ariel again, ‘what brings Mr Wilora to Lyn’s humble little family restaurant tonight?’ Ariel wanted to conserve energy by not speaking, but fighting his protesting stomach, he explained how Pavel turned up at the Computing Club. ‘And this is why you did not go to the club today?’ Ariel added. ‘You forgot that was a school club. I know pretty much everyone has a strong tie to some sort of club, but it was meant to be a hobby at the end of the day. You aren’t supposed to force yourself to go every single day like turning up for work!’ Ariel shrugged. ‘I didn’t force myself to go. It was a habit anyway.’ ‘Well, but, you know…’ Chase looked around, then leaned closer to Ariel, ‘the people from our class are starting to say you are a weirdo… that you hate everyone and just a computer nerd.’ ‘What?? No, I don’t! Who said that?’ Ariel asked, displeased by the comments but unsurprised by how he was perceived. ‘Umm… you know, just a few people from our class,’ Chase hesitated, ‘but the point is, as a mean to save you from the rumours, and as your friend, I strongly recommend you to put down your beloved computer and take a walk. Meet some people outside of your circle. There are quite a few interesting nice people outside the Computing Club, you know.’ ‘This is the second time someone said that to me today. And most interesting people tend to be not very nice.’ ‘You haven’t met enough people to make that conclusion. Even the school has more than just me, that arrogant Colin and your shy new best friend. Anyway, you would go and socialise a little right?’ Ariel thought for a second. ‘I am not against it, but how?’ Chase looked pleased, he slapped on the counter in approval. ‘The Debating Club needs quite a lot of help recently. They are recruiting more and more members and they are preparing for an international debating competition in Singapore against hundreds of schools and universities,’ said Chase as he pulled out a leaflet, ‘I have a few friends who are members, so I’ve been helping them with setting up practice venues, recruiting students and other stuff. I can definitely introduce you.’ The massive words ‘BE THE BEST’ stood out on the leaflet. The powerful graphic styles reminded Ariel of the British Army recruitment poster from the First World War, except instead of Lord Kitchener’s face, it was a crowd surrounding a man with a microphone on a spotlight-filled stage, and the paper quality was much nicer than anything the Computing Club had ever used. Ariel was impressed by the beautifully-made leaflet. ‘No wonder they called the Debating Club the King of all school clubs. Okay. I suppose I can take a look.’ ‘Awesome! Maybe hearing how these guys argue can give you a fresh perspective on getting out of your programming deadlock too.’ Ariel did not think of that, maybe there was an actual reason to go now. ‘Now that is out of the way, here is your medium chicken ramen with plenty of seaweed, no spice!’ said Chase as he put a bowl of what looked like the most delicious ramen ever on the counter. Ariel grabbed the ramen bowl from Chase immediately and wolfed down his dinner. The soup was rich in flavour with a mixture of chicken and Pierra’s famous seaweed, yet it was not as piping hot as usual. Ariel suspected Chase had been hiding his dinner under the counter all along. What kind of friend uses starvation as a bargaining chip for the other’s wellbeing? When Ariel nearly finished the fantastic ramen, the main door slid open and a cool draught rushed in. He shivered for a moment. ‘Welcome!’ greeted the chef and Chase together enthusiastically. ‘Hello, Mr Lyn,’ the customer who just walked in greeted in response, tidying her hair, ‘busy night tonight!’ It was unusual to see another schoolmate at this time of the day, not to mention she was pretty. Her long hair was slightly damped, untied and spread on her white Central Pierra white PE shirt like streams in a forest. Standing at the entrance with her shorts and pink training shoes, as if warning anyone not to challenge her to any kind of sports. She’s pretty as a doll. ‘Yeah very busy indeed,’ the chef took a break from the wok, ‘Pyon Border Patrol has some training exercise tonight I think.’ ‘We wouldn’t mind you coming on board with us miss!’ said one of the customers in a border patrol uniform with a cheeky smile. Ariel stared at the back of that man with disgust. That girl looked surprised but smiled politely in response, and then turned to the chef. ‘Can I have the usual batch, please? But just for eight people?’ ‘Yeah of course,’ said Mr Lyn, ‘two with no spice, one extra hot?’ ‘Yes, please. Thanks!’ Chase took a towel from somewhere and started wiping the counter, eventually made his way to the girl waiting for her order. ‘Hey Chase!’ the girl noticed Chase’s conspicuous approach. ‘Hey, Alya! First division rowing practice tonight?’ ‘Yeah. We have been doing time trials runs up and down along the river almost non-stop with Ken and the others. The water current is strong today and Mr Tam is on our necks all day. Oh, I am super exhausted.’ Chase smiled and poured her a glass of water. He pointed at Ariel, ‘Alya, that guy over there is Ariel, one of my mates from Computing Club. Ariel, this is Alya, a club mate from the Rowing Club.’ Alya waved at Ariel gently, with the most beautiful smile Ariel had ever seen. ‘Nice to meet you, Ariel.’ Ariel flustered a little. ‘Hi, nice to meet you… Alya?’ ‘Yeah, sorry. I didn’t introduce myself properly. I am Alya Khan from class 2A, and in the first division in the Rowing Club.’ ‘I’m… Ariel Wilora from class 2B,’ Ariel reintroduced himself. Although he had zero interest or connection with any of Central Pierra’s renown sports clubs, even he knew being in the first division of any large sports club was a golden ticket to international and professional competitions. ‘Wow, I didn’t know they allowed Grade 2 students in any sports club first division.’ Alya glanced sideways and smiled embarrassedly. ‘Well, rowing is kinda my hobby and pretty much the only thing I do since I was like five. I did quite a lot of practice sections back in primary school, but I suppose I was still quite lucky to make it to the first division,’ she explained carefully, ‘but it’s fun training with the others at the club! We have barbeques sometimes too, it’s great!’ ‘You are being too hard on yourself Alya.’ Chase said, ‘Ariel, you know she is the youngest first division rowers our school ever had. She is our ace rower.’ Alya responded with another smile. Chase’s dad gave her eight boxes of ramen in two takeaway plastic bags, but she took both over the counter with ease as if taking two water bottles. The heavy dinners posed no challenge to the years of rowing training. Neither Chase nor Ariel bothered to ask if she needed help. ‘I need to go back to the clubhouse now before my seniors shout at me,’ Alya said, ‘make sure you come by and hang out sometime. We have a great view and a nice fridge with drinks at the Rowing Club!’ ‘She is cute right?’ said Chase, as both of them watched her left the restaurant, ‘you are already making a start on meeting new friends, and with Alya too! I am impressed, man!’ ‘Oh shut up, you couldn’t take your eyes off her either’ said Ariel, as he looked for the twenty Pyonian dollars from his back pocket, ‘anyway, thanks for the life-saving ramen. It’s really delicious.’ ‘Thank you for your kind review, sir,’ said Chase, the encounter with Alya seemed to have put him in a good mood, ‘tomorrow, four o’clock. Don’t go anywhere after class.’ The next day, layers of thick clouds blanketed most of the sky, the October sun looked like a faint glowing pearl, and the chilling air breezed through every corner of the Pierra Central Secondary School. However, as usual, none of the students was intending to go home early straight after school, but today, many of them were walking out of the school gate towards the town. Ariel, for the first time in weeks, walked in the opposite direction from the usual path to the Computing Club, and it felt wrong in every way. Ariel was washed along with the crowd on the main road, where he stopped by a tree at Pierra Rectangle square to wait for Chase. A few dozens of students excitedly marched towards the town hall, which reminded Ariel of a concert he went to with his brother many years ago. Only today, there was no concert in sight, only a mysterious student gathering. Not even Zentrum Union could be seen through the narrow opening today. The visibility was horrible. Apart from the occasional boring community meetings with his parents, he rarely visited the town hall. It was a tired old place occupied by old town folks to play chess and reminisce the good old days. Ariel could not imagine anything exciting would happen in that old building. The strong winds made Ariel starting to regret his promise with Chase the night before. At last, Chase turned up with no sense of urgency, and oblivious of the fact that he was half an hour late. ‘Sorry, the school canteen had a sale on chocolate milk. I couldn’t resist,’ said Chase as he sipped from his bottle, ‘I swear I didn’t forget, cause I… care about my friends and promises, you know that sort of thing.’ ‘Whatever,’ said Ariel, hoping to get indoor before the storm came, ‘let’s go. What does Debating Club do anyway? Arguing philosophical questions?’ ‘I don’t know, but this is the one club that everyone wants to join,’ explained Chase, ‘they get to go on tours, oversea trips and stayovers, winning countless awards for the school, and get to see the top people in the government quite a lot too. I promise it is a lot better than it sounds.’ ‘Then why aren’t you in it?’ ‘You know I am already in the Computing Club, and also already a second division rower in the Rowing Club, right? Plus, I needed to help out at the noodle bar on Thursday, Friday and Saturday too!’ Ariel stopped just before the closed doors at the side entrance. Something was not adding up between who they were supposed to visit and this pale blue concrete building. ‘Umm… this is not how they usually have their debating practice right? Surly the old town folks like Mr Wilkinson or Mrs Mandalay or that crazy long-hair old man would not be happy to move somewhere else for their chess game?’ ‘This is why you picked such as great time to meet these guys,‘ said Chase with a mysterious smile, ‘and this is the reason why I know these guys and have been helping out in the last few weeks. This is a secret event, only those invited are allowed to join.’ Ariel pulled open the steel doors and met with waves of deafening cheers and applauds. The cold windy air was shut off in seconds. The inside was dark, but Ariel could tell it had been completely redecorated with Debating Club banners on every wall. The crowd formed a circle around the centre, where a stage had been built. Spotlights shining on the stage dominated the entire gym. This looked almost the same as the opening ceremony on the first day, but instead of uninterested students threatened by the senior teachers, everyone looked as if they were in the climax of a rock concert, no one took their eyes off the centre stage. None of what Ariel seeing was what he had in mind of what a Debating Club was and this could be the most excited crowd ever stood in this building. I must have entered a parallel universe somewhere along the way. Standing at the back of the crowd, Ariel finally caught a glimpse of who was on the centre stage, and questions exploded in Ariel’s head like fireworks."

      "chapterTitle": "Chapter 4 – The King of Clubs",
      "text": "For about ten years, the Debating Club had been combining its new school year recruitment and club practice into a single debating and partying evening that lasted till midnight. Rumour was in the early 90s, when club president then had this idea, only seniors and interested joiners were allowed. Although officially dubbed ‘Annual Debating Club Conference’, they nearly got expelled after the mess they’d made and a blackboard broken in half. It didn’t take long for them to start hiring the town hall for this ‘conference’ and continued the tradition outside the school. Until very recently, even junior students like Horace were allowed to join the fun, and he was as excited for this evening as he was nervous for screwing up. Horace felt his hand holding the microphone was trembling like a vibrating mobile phone. He took a deep breath and walked on to the centre stage. The spotlights were blinding, but he was glad that they were so bright in some way, because he could barely see the others staring at him in excitement. I still can’t believe I am delivering the opening speech for this year’s conference! He took another deep breath to calm himself down, and pressed on like he practiced for countless times. ‘Ladies and gentleman, welcome to our humble Debating Club,’ he paused for a second, ‘and our 20th Debating Conference!!’ The crowd cheered with deafening screams. ‘Ever since from 1990,’ Horace continued, ‘our brilliant predecessors, the true pioneers, the student founders of the Debating Club you see today, worked tirelessly day and night to gather students and get them to think outside the box.’ Several senior club members clapped in agreement. ‘We started this journey with nothing more than just discussions on classic but inspiring philosophy. It was almost impossible to compete with the more exotic clubs like the drama or music clubs.‘ A projector started blasting faded films of the club activities from the early 90s on a wall with no club banner hung on. ‘Things changed since they decided the conference was the way to go. We combined a great opportunity to have fun and make friends, and keeping that ability to push for intellectual boundary that we always strive for!’ Practically all one hundred Debating Club members were jumping and shouting in excitement now. Yes, this feels great. I feel like I’m in a rock concert. This is going to be the best conference ever. ‘However, time has changed,’ declared Horace, ‘the recent news and all that government policies have told us that we need to think independently as well. Not every rule makes sense. Not every policy benefits us. Not every decision is in our best interest. The Debating Club, on this 20th anniversary, will continue to be a base for those wanting to ask questions not only on philosophy, but also on where the government is leading us!’ ‘This is all about us here. Tonight, on behalf of all of us in Central Pierra Debating Club, I thank you all once again to join us in this revolution. The exclusive 20th Debating Club Conference now begins!’ Cheers and applauds blasted through the roof. Club president Maula nodded at him in approval. Horace felt his hand was shaking uncontrollably from the nervousness and adrenaline filled every fibre of his body, but he could not stop smiling too. Maula entrusted him with an important job such as this, and it seemed he aced it. ‘I will now pass the mic to Maula, our club president for a few words.’ When Horace climbed down the steps and high-fived the others in cheers, Ariel was standing at the back looking at him, mouth wide opened like a tunnel entrance. ‘What… I didn’t… Wh…What is going on?’ stuttered Ariel, looking in disbelief that he saw Horace here. ‘Hey man! I am so happy that you made it! I didn’t even have the chance to tell you what club I am in. How did you find this place?’ asked Horace. Ariel pointed at Chase. ‘I see, thanks for taking Ariel here. We certainly need more help for the Conference too, more volunteers is always welcome!’ Horace pushed him towards the club members. ‘Let me introduce my best friend, Ariel Wilora, he’s from my class too and in the Computing Club,’ Horace proudly introduced a reluctant Ariel to two girls standing near the juice stand, ‘I am sure he will do a great job helping out with our conference today.’ ‘What? I didn’t-‘ Chase smothered Ariel just in time to kill the protest. Someone called out to Horace to help at the centre stage. He was satisfied that he had set his friend on the path of getting his social life back on track, even Chase was there to keep an eye on him too. ‘Okay, I will leave you guys to it. Talk to you in a bit!’ said Horace as he vanished into the crowd. ‘Hi Ariel, I’m Annata Tyin from class 2A,’ one of the girls put her hand out with a friendly smile. Her short hair was just covering her shoulders, held together neatly with a silver hairclip. She was slightly shorter than the girl next to her, who didn’t smile as much as Annata. ‘I’m not actually in the Debating Club. I’m curious of what this famous Debating Club conference is all about, and to support Lu here too!’ Annata explained, putting her arm around the taller girl’s shoulder. ‘Hello, nice to meet you Annata… and Lu?’ responded Ariel politely, he could feel how disproportionally strong Annata’s handshake was compared to her small hand. And does this mean literally everyone can walk in to this exclusive and secret conference? ‘Yes, I’m Lu. Lu Maiya,’ said the slightly taller girl, who emotionlessly gave a small bow, ‘Good evening and nice to meet you too.’ This girl gave out a rather high-class aurora, something told Ariel that she had a different background to them, but more importantly, Ariel was quite certain that he heard that name from somewhere. Her stern look with a pair of thin glasses and long straight hair, looked like the new interim Principal Mrs Kim, minus the smile. ‘I didn’t know you are not in the Debating Club Annata, I saw you pretty much every time I come here to decorate the room! Is Lu a Debating Club member then?’ Chase inquired. Annata replied before Lu in a split second. ‘We’ve been friends since primary school. Lu somehow made it to the notoriously difficult-to-join Debating Club, and this is her first conference. Of course I need to support my best friend here!’ ‘But are you sure you are not forgetting your rowing practice? I am still divided between Computing Club and Rowing Club, but I haven’t seen you down there lately.’ Annata gave a thumb up to reassure Chase. ‘Don’t worry. I am going to make it to the second division like you before Christmas!’ ‘Ahh… excuse me, can I ask a few questions?’ interrupted Chase as he put his hand up like asking a question in class, ‘what are we doing here? I know you guys said “conference” like a thousand times but this still looks more like a concert than any club activities I’ve seen. And what’s it that you are helping? Why was Horace giving a speech like Martin Luther King Junior?’ he paused, ‘and you guys don’t have a club supervisor?’ ‘You are a sceptical one,’ Annata rolled her eyes, ‘to be honest most people not from the Debating Club are just here for the drinks and party a little. They are planning to have music between the debates you know. The Debating Club people need to do their debating practice and talk to the Grade 1s for promotion and stuff, so they find their friends outside the club to help run the conference. And their supervisor teacher is… Mr Kew I think? You know that laid-back literature teacher that doesn’t punish or shout at anyone.’ That explains a lot. ‘So, what are we doing then?’ asked Ariel. ‘They have a schedule, the seniors have the first philosophical debate with the juniors for the first hour, then it’s a 30-minute break, which is the fun bit. The second topic is on the latest school policy.’ Chase answered as he read through the leaflet. Lu looked like she suddenly remembered something. ‘I need to prepare for the first session now. Talk to you guys in a bit. See you soon Annata!’ ‘Okay, Lu. You’ll be great! Show these guys how it’s done!’ Annata waved her off, then turned to both boys immediately, ‘so let’s get started too!’ Ariel followed them through a door behind an old curtain and climbed a flight of narrow and steep concrete steps. He did not expect the existence of this secret area behind the main hall, which made Ariel looking forward to discovering what came next. They led Ariel to a room full of control panels, with a few glass panes facing towards the main room, providing a brilliant view of the heated debating battle that was about to begin. A senior student was sitting at the controls already, who looked relieved when they arrived. ‘Finally! Thanks for helping out guys,’ the guy took off his headset swiftly and passed it to Chase, ‘I’ll leave you to it then, any questions, just give me a call on the headset.’ Before Ariel could even see his face properly, he squeezed through the gap next to Ariel and disappeared down the stairs. ‘Well, I suppose the instructions were clear enough,’ Ariel said, ‘what are we doing here?’ ‘We are the backstage crew today,’ Chase pointed at the flickering lights on the panels, ‘we need to control the lights, audio all that stuff. Funny enough, they trust us to run the whole event when I told them I’d bring you along. Apparently you have quite a reputation in the Computing Club, Ariel.’ For the life of him, Ariel could not work out how on earth he gained some fame outside the club, nor was he pleased to become well-known. Although occasional help was needed from the others, getting too much unnecessary attention was always unwise. Phrases like ‘could you help’ and ‘just this once’ and ‘I owe you’ would flood in from everywhere, and Ariel was not interested in giving a hand to the entire school. Ariel quietly nodded and sat down on the left side. The massive control panel looked expensive, and was so new that it looked very out of place in this smelly old room. I wonder who paid for this, whoever that was didn’t have a good idea of how often this place is used. The panels reminded Ariel of a class play that he took part with Horace in primary school. That time, he needed to play a soldier following the prince, who was Horace, on his way to defeat the dragon and save the princess. Unfortunately, the cardboard armour that Ariel was wearing had a loose tape, and he tripped over his own armour in front of everyone. The school burst into laughter. Ariel still remembered the embarrassment at that very second. Despite Horace tried to save the scene then, the traumatic experience had made Ariel to stay away from spotlights ever since, and only help in the backstage for every play for the rest of the primary school years. He never expected to sit behind one of these so soon after graduating for a little over a year. I hate all these buttons and switches and the flickering green lights. ‘Are you okay? You look tense,’ said Annata, ‘don’t worry, the agenda’s not too complicated. Everyone will be watching the debate anyway.’ ‘Yeah I’m fine.’ ‘Look. They are starting now,’ Chase pointed at the stage, where three people were standing on each end facing each other, preparing for the first debate of the night, ‘we need to…erm… turn up the spotlight.’ Lu knew well that this was only a practice round, but being the first debate demonstration of the conference, she understood that she needed to perform as if this was the real thing. Club president Maula specifically told them not to rehearse beforehand to ‘maintain authenticity’, and now she was standing next to two of her teammates, one of them is Horace from class 2B, facing the other team across, made of a group of seniors, smiling confidently. The spotlight blasted on the stage suddenly, which blinded Lu for a second. At the same time, Maula walked to the centre of the stage and introduced the teams to the audience. After a round of applaud, she announced the topic of that Lu was so eager to learn. ‘I know recently there’ve been talks on how some new school rules affect the student life,’ said Maula, ‘so let’s start from there. Today’s topic is… Every student should agree and obey the school rules, or face punishment.’ The crowd felt silent in an instant, the anti-climactic sentence was not something they expected from the Debating Club president. Lu was stunned too. This will practically anger everyone in this room. ‘Ben, Lex, you will argue for this topic,’ Maula pointed at the seniors and continued as if she hadn’t noticed the mood change, ‘Horace, Lu, you will argue against this topic. Let’s kick off with the seniors!’ Lex moved one step forward and spoke. ‘We are affirmed that all the students should obey to the all school rules no matter what they are. Primarily it’s because this enforces discipline and makes us work better as a team. We at the Central Pierra Secondary School pride ourselves with our diverse and high-performing club activities. We have won countless national and international competitions in many fields with Rowing Club, Football Club, Drama Club, Music Club, and this is because of teamwork! We have a culture where everyone stays in line and works together for one single goal. School rules and obedience makes us get there.’ A handful of claps echoed in the dark, but at least no one booed. ‘We disagree that all students should listen to every school rule,’ Lu stepped forward for her turn, ‘referring back to what you said, we indeed have a strong team working culture and we do have countless great clubs, but that spirit doesn’t come from discipline and blindly following rules and orders. We do our best in our clubs because we love doing it. Every student is given the freedom to choose what they do and how they go about it. That freedom given to the students is what empowers them to find their interest and passion and the school should support us from there.’ ‘That might work if you have mutual respect and they automatically work together. In a team, you need discipline in the team and listen to leader. The same also applies to the whole school. We believe that the school management, the principal, deputy principal, knows that best for the school. There is a reason behind every school rule, and when all students follow them all, we are all stronger as a single team, no matter what class, grade or club we are in.’ Lex was standing her ground, being one of the most experienced Debating Club veterans. Although Lu knew that Lex did not mean what she said, she could not help feeling a little repulsed by the idea. Some whispers started in the audience, disturbed by the reasoning behind forming strict school rules. Even the students who came for the free drinks were also drawn to the show. Lu fought back. ‘There is no firm evidence that every school rule is for the benefit for the student. I have a recent example. The school recently stopped all students from logging onto the government websites. Some students in the Computing Club and Grade 4 are already affected by this new rule. Stopping this information has already caused problems for the Computing Club, some students might not even be able to go for competition because of this! How is that school rule helping our club performance? Obeying unreasonable rules like this, not only hinders our capabilities, but also undermines our potentials as students!’ A crowd of Grade 1 students cheered out loudly with a few claps, Lu smiled. Ben took over the microphone from Lex. ‘Well, that’s just one isolated example,’ argued Ben calmly, ‘it is possible that the school did that for security reasons. There aren’t too many reasons for students to be sniffing around on the government data anyway. If everyone is free to act under their own free will and do whatever they please, no one will turn up at volleyball training in the early morning, no one will stay behind to practice with the teams. Academically, students might even fall behind on their school works and start to rebel against the teachers. This is a school and we are here to learn, in both classrooms and clubrooms. There is a certain amount of disciplines within every team, and following the school rules, no matter what they are, not only makes us work towards the same goal, but also trains our discipline. What you are suggesting has unimaginable consequences.’ Lu felt like she’d hit a brick wall. I’m running out of ideas. They had brushed off her example casually and kept on dwelling on that discipline thing. There is no way that every student should listen to whatever the school says like an army of robots, but no arguments in her mind could help her win this fight. As she felt her throat became dry, Horace suddenly took the microphone from her hands. ‘You are right,’ said Horace with a smile, ‘we’d never be at where we are if there is zero discipline along. Like you said, no one will be bothered to practice, train or study if there is no discipline or punishment, but let’s wind back a little here. What we are discussing is that every student should obey every school rule, no matter what they are, and your reasoning being that would train discipline and assuming every student listens to the school, the whole school would be a strong team, yeah?’ ‘That’s correct.’ Ben said. ‘There are two flaws here. First of all, the students here at Central Pierra are clever students, more than capable of independent thinking. It will be obvious very quickly as to which rule should be followed and which shouldn’t. Therefore, by forcing us to following every rule, no matter what they are, has no benefit in terms of discipline.’ Ben and his team remained silent. Lu could see several heads were nodding behind them. ‘Secondly, you said that every student should fall in-line with the school,’ Horace pressed on, ’no matter what kind of rules they brought up, to work as a “better team” doesn’t make sense. Our school has been allowing the students free to express themselves, to take part in all kind of activities. The school rules we’ve been having are just for day-to-day business like academic works, not being late for lessons. There’s no single objective for these school rules to make us a “better team”, and if the school wants us to be better in exams, in competitions, why did they, like my teammate Lu said, have new school rules like no accessing government websites? And an even more recent example, I heard some candidates running for Student Council president are having their posters, pamphlets getting vetted by the new interim principal, because of another new school rule. Something like that would never happen in the past, with Mr Larkin.’ More whispers in the dark, but anyone could sense a change of tides in this debate. At the other end of the stage, Ben smiled with satisfaction, but did not speak. ‘Like Lu said, those school rules are already causing problems for clubs, and Grade 4s are kept from doing their homework, so clearly not all school rules make us to perform better, and a few students are already quite upset over this, and how is that going to help the discipline?’ continued Horace confidently, keeping his flow like a river, ‘Also, is breaking some of the rules really a bad thing? Personally, I think it’s a sign of a student wouldn’t say “yes” to everything and would do some independent thinking. Staying in-line isn’t always a good thing, it kills how you actually feel, what you want to do, what kind of person you want to becom…’ Horace’s speech was interrupted by Lu when she pulled his sleeves and stared at him. He is getting too excited. Horace noticed his mistake, cleared his throat and continued. ‘One more point, our value and excellent club results don’t just come from hard work, but original ideas, imaginations and creativity. If we just follow the rulebook, there’s a danger that the leader of the school would think we are always a step ahead in everything, because everyone’s in order, but in reality we’d be two steps behind, because we’d just copy what other schools did. Therefore, the students mustn’t follow all of the school rules, even if they are unreasonable.’ A moment of silence loomed in the hall. The occasion whispering and noises of snacking at the back disappeared all in a sudden. Everyone was looking at Ben now. Ben spoke into the microphone. ‘You are right, Horace. Maula, we have nothing more to add.’ The room erupted in cheers and applauds. Every pair of eyes looked at them in admiration and awe, especially the juniors. Lu wanted to enjoy this moment, but most of her was just glad that this was over. She knew that an awkward silence would be the only impression if Horace hadn’t taken over, and it was not only embarrassing, but it meant that you’ve practically lost the debate. Phew, luckily Horace is here. Maula walked up the stage whilst clapping, she looked as cheerful as always. ‘Clearly, our young Grade 2 students have won against the seniors! They have done a fantastic performance. Can we give a round of applauds to everyone here! Lex, Ben, Lu and Horace!!!’ she waved her arm like a pop singer, and more cheers followed suit. Lu took a bow with Horace, she noticed her legs hadn’t stop shaking this whole time. After witnessing the impressive debate and a club member had taken over the backstage controls, Ariel, Annata and Chase could not wait to catch up with them, but finding Horace and Lu in the crowd of hyped-up Grade 1 juniors was not as easy as Ariel thought. There’s no way this is an exclusive conference. Maula mentioned the next debating demonstration would be in another thirty minutes. ‘And the topic is - whether Pyon should keep accepting migrants from Zentrum Union!’ she announced, ‘before that, make sure you join our club!’ Finally, it turned out Lu and Horace had just managed to escape the enthusiastic keen joiners, who were directed by the other club members to fill in the forms. As a reward of the successful demonstration, they were enjoying some concentrated orange juice by the juice stand. ‘That was really good, guys!’ shouted Chase, ‘I feel like I’m in the United Nations or Parliament.’ ‘Well done and congratulations!’ Annata went up and gave Lu a hug, ’did you see how you impressed the juniors? They were completely soaked in it! Excellent job!’ Horace smiled and shrugged. ‘Well, it was a just a demonstration… Everyone did a great job up there, and I couldn’t have done it without Lu here!’ Lu looked a little surprised by his comment. ‘Umm… same to you too Horace,’ she added. Ariel was going to offer his congratulations too, but something about Lu was just too… familiar. He was definitely sure that he knew her name and face from somewhere, but nothing came to mind. This tingling feeling at the back of Ariel’s head was driving him crazy. Just when he was about to ask, he was interrupted by a white flash from behind. ‘Dude, that was perfect - a warm celebration after the first debate demo at the first conference,’ muttered the tall cameraman behind his camera, leaning down slightly to shoot from the best angle. ‘Who’re you? Isn’t it quite rude to take photos of the others without permission?’ Chase asked. ‘Sorry dude. I’m the official camera guy,’ said the dedicated cameraman, who had just taken another photo, ‘name’s Lee. Class 3D and with the Documentary Photography Club.’ Everyone was still blinded by the dazzling camera flash. Ariel tried to drive this inconsiderate guy away. ‘Please turn off your camera flash at least, and I have never heard of Documentary Photography Club.’ ‘What? You’ve never heard of us?’ he asked in shock. ‘No. What’s that?’ ‘I told you. It’s what it says on our name: Documentary Photography Club,’ he said proudly, ‘and I’m the club president too. We document what’s happening at our school truthfully with our skills and our cameras. Unlike the Art Photography Club people, we don’t deal with Photoshop, or artistic feeling… we tell stories through pictures!’ ‘And my friends and I talking was one of your stories?’ asked Ariel agitatedly. ‘Yes indeed dude. Everyone wants to know what happened in the first event of the King of all clubs!’ ‘Next time, ask before you snap a picture alright?’ said Chase, stepping in between Lee and Ariel. ‘There are more to see in this conference, Lee. Look, Maula is just over there.’ After Lee ran off into the darkness, he asked Ariel confusedly, ‘Why do you always on the edge of getting into a fight when you start speaking? It happened in the Computing Club on the first day too.’ ‘He shouldn’t have come and just snapped pictures at us, that was quite rude.’ Ariel protested. ‘It’s fine Chase, Ariel was just trying to get him off,’ said Annata, still clinging on to Lu, ‘so how did you find the debate? Lu and Horace did a great job right?’ ‘That was more interesting than I thought,’ said Ariel, almost forgot to congratulate them after calling a stranger being rude, ‘your club president, Maula, was very clever to give you that topic too.’ ‘How so?’ asked Lu. ‘Well,’ explained Ariel, ‘I suppose a lot of the students are around for the food and hanging out with their friends, like what we are doing here, but Maula kicked things off with something nobody wants to hear – obeying the school rules no matter what they are? That got the attention of everybody because no one expected the famed Debating Club would support this nonsense.’ Horace and Lu took a look at each other, who seemed to have never thought about it. Ariel continued. ‘Also, by having you and Horace arguing against that, you are playing the hero against the seniors. Most joiners are going to be Grade 1 students, only one year behind us, and that gives them confidence that even juniors like us can win with facts and logic. Your president has some great tactics, and she placed more trust in you two than you think probably. She was practically betting on your wits.’ ‘See? I told you he’s the smartarse from Computing Club,’ said Chase, which Annata and Horace giggled in agreement, but Lu still looked in awe. The lights started to dim again. Everyone went to the stage to watch the next demonstration, looking forward to the any heated exchange coming from the controversial topic on immigrants, but the group of new friends just decided to stand at the back and watch the show. Ariel enjoyed the evening more than he expected, he could never understand something like watching a match at the football club where twenty two people chasing a ball for nearly two hours. Listening to them strategically throwing each other’s arguments over the fence was refreshing compared to the usual Computing Club life. The audience got more and more dispersed as the conference went on, and fewer juniors were within the crowd. Before anyone had realised, the most popular exclusive event finally come to an end. ‘Thank you all coming to the 20th Debating Conference,’ said the club president, taking a perfect bow, ‘I hope you’d enjoyed our little show, and see you soon at the Activities Fair!’ Lu and Horace stayed behind to clean up and debriefed with the rest of the club, so Ariel left the town hall with Chase and Annata. The gushy autumn wind filled with droplets of rain. It reminded him that he’d never spent that much time in that building, but it was no torture like the town meetings with his parents. In fact, it was one of the best nights he’d had in a while. It was nearly eleven at night, but he was wide awake from the aftertaste of the debates. ‘This storm will be a strong one,’ Chase looked at the trees by the square, branches and leaves were violently scratching one another, ‘how’re you getting home Lu?’ ‘Eh… my family sent a car to pick me up,’ said Lu, somehow a little embarrassed by that arrangement. At that moment, a black Mercedes pulled up next to them. Lu was about to get into the backseat, but she stopped and turned to Ariel and Chase. ‘Sorry, my parents don’t all… I mean they want me back home as soon as I can,’ she said, ‘umm… I’ll see you two at school, I guess?’ ‘Don’t worry about it, Ariel and I can handle ourselves. See you at school, Lu.’ The black saloon drove off as soon as she closed the door, and the pair of rear lights soon vanished around the closed shops. Chase also parted with Ariel and walked in the opposite direction. Half an hour later, Ariel collapsed onto his own bed. Mum and dad and his brother were already asleep. The house was creepily quiet, only the sound of water dripping from his soaked uniform echoing the darkness. Ariel changed into his pajamas, and went downstairs to get some warm water before going to bed. He leaned against the kitchen counter, emptily stared at the wall clock as the second hand ticked its way through midnight. The debates were more exciting and somewhat inspiring than he’d admitted in front of his friends earlier, and he was still trying digest as to why he’d felt that way. He took another sip from the glass, and glanced at the display cupboard next to the wall clock. It had all sorts of mum and dad’s stuff in it, family photos from that trip to Thailand, Ariel holding baby Kyle in his arms, mum and dad’s wedding, dad’s business being bought by a big company from Melian City… A sudden shock split through his mind like a lightning strike, because Ariel had just found the answer to the question that he had been wondering the whole evening. In the picture where his dad was shaking hands with his new boss a few years ago, a child Lu Maiya was standing next to the men in suits, smiling at the camera."

      "text": "In the next few weeks, Ariel found himself visiting the Debating Club more than he expected. Before the conference, he wouldn’t even think twice about going anywhere except the Computing Club after school. Right now, although not joining any debates himself, he enjoyed watching and hearing people debating in a room, which jogged his ideas for working his computer program. Colin from the Computing Club had noticed this and started to complain about Ariel’s loyalty had shifted to a club ‘that never shuts up’. Being kicked out from the club would be a headache – he would not be allowed to join the National Hackathon next year, and considering he had just taken Pavel under his wings in some way, Ariel decided to go to the Computing Club on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and just pop down to the Debating Club on the last two weekdays. Chase, Annata and even Alya became regulars at the Debating Club room too, Ariel was secretly glad to see he wasn’t the only one using the club as a hangout spot. Even they just used an empty classroom in the Main Teaching Building as their base, which could barely fit forty people, visitors like Ariel and the others were always welcome. Days went by like an arrow, and it was already mid-November. Today was a Friday, but it was a rare school holiday, so Ariel’s body clock just made him woke up the same time as usual. ‘Do we have any orange juice?’ Ariel asked as he was deciding if he should walk to the fridge. ‘You’ve got legs, check it yourself,’ said Kyle, who was glued to the television from the sofa. Ariel sighed and opened the fridge. Luckily half a box was still in there, so he poured the rest and made some toast, without jam. Toasts taste best with butter, not jam! He glanced at the photograph tucked in the cupboard. It had always been there as long as Ariel remembered, but what he realised last month made this framed picture felt like a timed bomb. Lu’s father is the man who bought my dad’s business… so my dad is working for Lu’s dad… It didn’t take long for Ariel to decide it was a terrible idea to let the others know this connection. Everything was fine as it was and he didn’t want to ruin it. More importantly, he didn’t want to act as some sort of subordinates around Lu, in case he annoyed her by mistake in some way and told her father. That’d be the worst case scenario. ‘I’m home!’ A voice came from the door like music to the brothers’ ears. ‘Mum!’ Kyle immediately jumped from the sofa and ran into mum’s arms. ‘Let your mum take a break boys. She’s been working all night in the office,’ Dad said as he closed the door and nudged Kyle with three grocery plastic bags, ’and she still bought you snacks from Melian City too!’ Kyle screamed in excitement when he saw his favourite bacon-flavoured crackers came in bulk. Ariel carried the groceries bags to the kitchen. ‘How are you coming back home in the morning?’ he said. ‘Well Ariel, that’s just city life in Melian,’ mum said with a tired smile, ‘and we had to work really overtime to deal with the expense claims of the city police.’ ‘Why? What’s going on?’ asked the surprised dad. ‘Oh! They didn’t show it on the news here? Apparently the higher-ups signed a trade deal with Zentrum Union for their crops just last week. So we will be getting lots more rice, fruits, vegetables from the other side of the fence now.’ ‘I thought we are not on good terms with the Zentrumians? Why are we paying them?’ ‘And honey, that’s why there was a protest,’ she turned on the news, a group of people angrily shouting and waving their signs in front of a government building, ‘do you ever watch the news?’ ‘The kids do, it’s always the same old stuff.’ Dad said. Kyle put up a proud smile, but Ariel wondered how dad knew what they were doing in breakfast when he was always working. ‘Honey, it doesn’t hurt when you take a look once or twice,’ said mum, ‘look how many officers they had around the building. They had been there since Monday and the expense claims were coming in like a waterfall! Every one of us in the audit office had to go through the pile like mad!’ ‘Oh dear, that was awful.’ ‘And Mandy the manager kept losing the papers too, we were very close to snapping at her this week,’ said mum as she collapsed on the sofa, ‘but at least we went through our work, so I’m home now.’ ‘Let me give you a massage mum!’ Kyle went up to rub mum’s shoulders enthusiastically. ‘Thanks Kyle,’ said mum, ‘but… aren’t you running late for school?’ Kyle jumped at an instant and looked at the clock in horror, then dashed upstairs to get change. Mum then rolled to her side towards Ariel. ‘And you Ariel?’ ‘Umm… today’s a holiday for us. Tomorrow’s the Activities Fair and they are spending today preparing for it.’ ‘Don’t you need to help? With the Computing Club and all that?’ ‘I am going to,’ said Kyle as he swallowed the last mouthful of orange juice, thinking how he’d actually sneak off to hang out with the Debating Club instead, ‘just in the afternoon I think.’ ‘I didn’t know you have no school today boy!’ said dad cheerfully, which made mum looked at him with a hint of dissatisfaction. Dad seemed to have noticed that he just revealed the lack of attention he had been paying to his sons. ‘Eh… I need some help with a delivery Ariel, come on and give me a hand. They need it by noon.’ Ariel sighed loudly in protest. ‘I can’t really go dad… with the preparations with the club and everything…’ ‘Oh right! Tomorrow’s your Activities Fair isn’t it? That’s why they wanted this delivery so urgently,’ said dad, whilst grabbing Ariel by his arm, ‘don’t worry about it, we will be back by noon. You’ll still have an entire afternoon for your club.’ Half an hour later, a reluctant Ariel was already sitting by his dad in their truck. It was carrying a small white boat at the back, and its owner was keen to get it today. Dad kept on droning about how difficult it was to refurbish that boat and get it looking as good as new, but Ariel barely heard a single word, he was wondering how to showcase his project with the club to get more attention tomorrow. Ariel caught wind that some of the Hackathon judges might go to the Activities Fair tomorrow too. Dad made a right turn and turned off from the main road. They were on a narrow street now, trying to squeeze through their truck between the people and several cyclists. Although dad drove behind everyone patiently, their presence still drew some attention. An old lady stared at them disapprovingly from her balcony. ‘Odd place to live for someone wanting a 300-horsepower boat…’ dad murmured. They made turns in the maze of alleyway. Even though Ariel grew up in this town, he never truly figured out the layout of this clutter of densely-built houses. He wasn’t even sure if they were lost or not, but that’s not his problem if the delivery was late. Suddenly, they were met with a vast open view of the River Perryson, with the outline of Zentrum Union in the background. Ariel soon realised they were at the waterfront, where the rowing clubhouses and boathouses of every school in this town are located. They slowly drove along each boathouse. Ariel winded down the window to enjoy the breeze, and dad was carefully checking the plagues against the invoice address. ‘There we are, finally!’ The truck stopped abruptly in front of a two-storey white boathouse. Ariel first saw Alya training hard on a rowing machine by the stacks of boats, before realising the delivery was for his own school. After refusing to believe that ‘it was a surprise’, Ariel helped winged the boat from the back of the truck to the club’s boat trailer and several tall muscular senior students pushed the trailer into the shed next to the boathouse. Ariel wondered if that boat was part of tomorrow’s Activities Fair display as they were over the moon to see it. He had never been here before, even after knowing Chase and meeting Alya and Annata. He stepped inside and looked around the boathouse. There was a damp and moisty smell inside. The sleek-looking narrow boats were stacked up all the way to the ceiling, each shining under the white light. They were even narrower than one person, but looked fast even on a shelf, as if begging to be raced. Each shelf could hold four boats vertically, but some were missing from their space, presumably being used on the river now. There was barely enough room for three people between the boat racks, but they still had several rowing machines on the aisles. Alya was still training hard on one of them and seemed to be too focus on her training to notice Ariel. He decided not to disturb her and went round to the next aisle. Again, more stacked boats neatly placed on the shelf. There was one being painted behind the shelfs, with a massive warning sign next it, which said ‘TOUCH IT AND YOU WILL BE CLEANING THE FLOOR FOR A MONTH!!!’ ‘Hey excuse me’, said a woman walking out from the office, ‘visitors are not allowed here.’ ‘Umm… I’m not…’ Ariel wasn’t sure he should identify himself as a deliverer or a student. He wasn’t wearing his uniform today after all. ‘It’s alright coach! I know Ariel, he’s from 2B.’ Ariel turned around to Ayla drenched in sweat from the exercises. She was waving at him cheerfully by the entrance. ‘I see,’ said the coach, looking slightly more relaxed, ‘we have some expensive boats here, so we don’t want strangers to be nosing around here.’ ‘Don’t worry. He’s not nosing around, just visiting us, right Ariel?’ Ariel nodded. The coach promptly went back to the office. ‘So what brings you here? You don’t seem to have been here before.’ asked Alya as they walked back outside. ‘I was helping my dad with a delivery.’ ‘Delivery…?’ Alya looked in the boathouse to see if there was anything out of ordinary. ‘Oh, I don’t think I’ve ever said this to you. My dad owns a small business that repairs small boats.’ ‘You are kidding!’ Alya’s eyes lit up, ‘and the delivery can’t possibly be…’ Ariel pointed to the shed where dad and some students had pushed the boat to. ‘The White Maiden is back!!’ Alya was over the moon when she caught eye of the small boat, and ran towards it like a mother finding her long-lost child. Ariel did not expect that much reaction but followed her to the shed. The others were examining the boat admirably, almost drooling over the smooth white paint. Ariel could understand the feeling of having a passion over something, being a computer guy and all, but they looked at the boat like a rock star was in town. ‘She’s been away from us for nearly a year now,’ Alya explained, ‘she’s a training boat that we drive side by side to the rowing boats, so that the coach can give instructions to the rowers.’ ‘Can’t the coach row next to them or sit on the boat as well?’ ‘Rowing and shouting? No one has that kind of strength, Ariel,’ Alya giggled, ‘and you’ve seen our shells as well. We can’t fit one extra person on them, there just aren’t enough room.’ ‘Shells…?’ ‘Oh, sorry, it’s how we call the narrow rowing boats that you saw in the boathouse. They are called racing shells.’ Every day is a school day, Ariel thought, even on a holiday. ‘So why did you send it for repair, what happened to it?’ ‘Umm. There was an accident. She is one of our fastest and she’s great to drive, so we tend to use her for longer distance training on rougher waters. You know, it’s still technically a river between us and Zentrum Union, but it’s so wide and long that it feels like rowing in the sea sometimes,’ Alya continued, but her face suddenly turned serious, ‘that one night… about a year ago, the guys were doing some training off the shores, and The White Maiden was following them like usual. There was no wind, and you could see every star in the sky, but…’ Alya sighed and paused for a second. ‘…but the fog just suddenly appeared out of nowhere. That wasn’t in the forecast, and the fog was so thick that they could barely see each other. Then… well, another boat that was also lost in the fog crashed into The White Maiden on the side. It was a miracle that it didn’t sink on the spot, the coach was driving her and made it back here, and everyone was sent to the hospital. Luckily the other boat didn’t crash into the rowers, someone would have probably died.’ ‘So what happened to the other boat?’ ‘It didn’t stop, apparently it was double the size of Maiden, they probably didn’t even realise they’ve hit someone at all,’ Alya replied with a grudge, ‘they nearly killed my friends and they just left! And before you ask, no one saw what boat that was because of the fog.’ ‘Wow… unbelievable.’ A series of rapid footsteps approached from behind, and before Ariel could look, someone jumped onto his back and pushed him on the ground. ‘Police! We’ve found the missing suspect!’ said a familiar voice from the person sitting on Ariel. ‘Can you stop doing that over and over?’ Ariel yelled, ‘Chase, everyone is looking at us!’ ‘Ha. I do that over and over to train your reaction Ariel,’ said Chase, ‘you should know that by now.’ ‘Doesn’t mean I am OK with it! Get off me man!’ ‘Oh what’s going on here? Looks like you guys are having fun.’ Another familiar voice approached from behind, except this time, it was a woman’s. Ariel was relieved that he could breathe again after Chase promptly got off, but that feeling vanished as soon as he sat up to see the principal looking at them. ‘Sorry Mrs Kim, we are just messing around.’ Chase apologised. She laughed for a second. ‘Don’t worry, I am not angry. Tomorrow’s the Activities Fair and you guys are supposedly to have fun with your clubs.’ ‘We’ll be careful next time,’ said Ariel. ‘Good to know. I don’t think I’ve been here too often, can you show me around?’ ‘I can do that Mrs Kim,’ Alya volunteered, ‘Ariel is just visiting today.’ As the pair disappeared round the corner, Chase grabbed Ariel up and reminded him that everyone at the Computing Club have been busy preparing for tomorrow. Chase spent the money cleaning the room, which was filthier than he thought; Colin was directing the club members where to move their creations, but also readying the posters and flyers for the visitors; Pavel was given the responsibility of setting up the computers to showcase everyone’s programs. ‘But you,’ said Chase,’ have been flirting with a girl with hands in your pockets. Do you feel ashamed?’ ‘I’ve been trying to explain. I was helping my dad…’ ‘Doesn’t matter,’ Chase shook his head, ‘let’s get on with it now!’ It was not how exactly Ariel planned his day, but at least he could finally get back to the Computing Club, despite the many angry faces staring at Ariel after being over an hour late. The next morning, Ariel got up early in an attempt to redeem himself. The November air was freezing and refreshing at the same time. He arrived at the school in the morning mist, it was as quiet as a library in exam season, but he was looking forward to the fun of the Activities Fair. The whole purpose of the day was to show off how talented the Central Pierra Secondary School students are to the visitors, parents and aspiring students with each club’s activities. Most schools tend to have an open day to welcome guests with their academic results, lessons and a few sports, but as most students came to this school for its activities anyway, they decided to dedicate the day to every school club instead. Ariel hopped on the familiar staircase to the IT room. The entire floor was transformed. The grey and plain walls and hallway were covered with the cooking club’s posters, the music club’s blinking signs, the tea club’s decorations, and of course, computing clubs’ fancy-looking robots lining up outside the IT room. Despite being this being the second Activities Fair, Ariel was still amazed how much the hallway was transformed in such short time. To his surprise, he was not the first one to arrive despite being two hours early. Pavel was concentrating on his computer when Ariel slid open the IT room door, probably doing some final adjustments. ‘You are hardworking Pavel.’ Ariel patted on his back. ‘Uhh… yes. I don’t want to mess up my first Activities Fair and let everyone down.’ Ariel switched on one of the computers. ‘You are already doing better than most people here Pavel. Don’t get too nervous.’ ‘Okay. Colin said something similar yesterday too.’ He obviously thinks Pavel is smarter than me. ‘Anyway… just smile and answer the parents’ questions as truthfully as you can, but not too truthfully if that makes sense…’ Pavel nodded. They went on to finish setting up each computer in the room. Pavel even made some posters with simple graphics to make the club looked less intimidating. Ariel admitted the club looked a lot friendlier with the colourful papers on the wall. Colin and the others arrived after the pair did most of the work, and they were equally impressed. At nine a.m., Pavel shouted excitedly that first visitor had entered the school. He had been watching the school gate from the hallway. It took another twenty minutes for the first group to visit the club. Everyone put on their friendliest faces to the best of their abilities and explained everything like salesmen on their first day of work. Another hour passed and the school was soon swarmed by the visitors. It did not help when the student council president announced there would be a drama performance in half an hour. Ariel felt his smile got stiffer and stiffer by the minute, but still handing out flyers at the entrance. Today was also the official day for the Grade 1 students to join the school clubs after the chaotic first day. Reminding himself of the glory of winning the National Hackathon and shoving the trophy to Colin’s face, Ariel overcame the pain from his feet and persuaded every passer-by to join the club, and casually mentioned his project to win the competition if they cared to stop. Pavel was also hard at work in recruiting Grade 1s to assist Ariel. Although he was a little shy to begin with, he had managed to spread the words to a few dozens of his classmates after just one hour. By noon, Ariel was exhausted. He decided to swing by the Debating Club and grab Horace and Chase for lunch at the canteen. As he walked through the hallway full of visitors and students pointing and laughing at different colourful displays, he realised that Chase did not show up at all. Although Chase was also in the Rowing Club, it was strange that he went quiet completely. According to the Activities Fair brochure, the Debating Club was on the other classroom building. Luckily, there was a bridge on the third floor and he did not have to squeeze through the sea of spectators in the main courtyard. Apparently the basketball team just became the highlight of whole school with that three-point field goal. ‘Hey Ariel!’ A distinctive but annoying voice penetrated Ariel’s ears like a bullet. Vito Lanker, the classmate that he’d always disliked but unfortunately been in the same class this year, was walking towards him from the other side with his gang. Ariel never bothered to learn their names. ‘What are you standing here daydreaming of? Lost your computer?’ Ariel grunted. ‘Was on my way to the Debating Club.’ ‘Ah. The guys with endless arguments and don’t shut up.’ You are the one who never shut up. ‘Interesting that you got out from that computer room,’ Vito smirked and continued, ‘are you looking for even more people to argue?’ Ariel sighed. ‘Get out of my way Vito. Don’t you have your drama club play in like half an hour?’ ‘Indeed,’ he said proudly, ‘I am playing the main character Pete. It’s going to great cause my family paid for the costumes and props. My mum being in the PTA wants to see the drama club having a huge success.’ Here we go again. ‘I think the Debating Club will be even more popular, do you know how many people went to the Conference?’ Vito made an annoying laugh again. ‘That’s funny. Even if they are more popular, how long do you think they could keep that up?’ ‘Wait,’ said Ariel, ‘they have been doing that for a long time. Of course it will keep being popular.’ Vito looked surprised. He turned and looked at his friends, who shrugged, then faced at Ariel. ‘You didn’t know?’ ‘Know what?’ They burst into laughter. Their screaming voices made Ariel even angrier now, he was fighting the urge not to become violent. ‘Know WHAT?’ Vito wiped a tear from his eye. ‘Ha… ha… you didn’t know and still act like you know what you are doing. You are on your way to them anyway, so you will see. It’s a surprise.’ Ariel pushed them aside and continued walking. Vito shouted from the back, ‘serve them right after robbing the spotlights of drama club! What a bunch of…’ After a few anxious minutes of hurriedly running past the astronomy, chemistry and literature club, Ariel barged in to the Debating Club whilst catching his breathe. ‘Ariel?’ said Horace Pham, looking up in surprise. Everyone briefly stopped their work to look at Ariel as well. At first glance, the decorations were what you’d expect from the Debating Club: Boards displaying photos of the past competitions and massive banners announcing some of the topics they had attempted before. A few notebooks were opened on a desk at one corner, seemingly showing how they planned each debate. So what was Vito talking about? Was that a prank? ‘What’s wrong?’ asked Annata, who came to Ariel with Lu and Chase. ‘I… I didn’t see anyone of you today yet, so…’ Ariel decided to make up an excuse, Vito was probably playing a prank on him. ‘Well of course! We were swamped with visitors today!’ Annata laughed. ‘So… is everything okay here?’ ‘As good as always! Why?’ ‘Don’t worry about it. It’s just I ran into Vito on the bridge five minutes ago, he said there are problems in the Debating Club.’ Horace suddenly jumped, but quickly back to smiling. ‘Vito said that? He’s probably messing with you then.’ Ariel noticed Lu had been keeping silent, she seemed worried, but before Ariel could ask, more visitors with dozens of pamphlets crowded in and Lu hurried to welcome them. ‘We are running out of space here,’ said Horace, ‘can you help me with moving some boxes out from the classroom?’ Ariel said yes, and Annata and Chase volunteered as well. There were a pile of cardboard boxes behind one of the display boards. They stacked them on a trolley and shakenly wheeled them to the hallway. With the crowds moving the other way, Ariel felt like a salmon swimming against the current. ‘Where are we taking ‘em?’ asked Chase. ‘Let’s take these to the lift for now,’ said Horace slowly, holding on to the box on the top. The four of them reached the lift. Being the only lift of this building, Ariel imagined it must have been going up and down constantly for the whole morning. Ten minutes later, they eventually made it to the basketball court. Annata and Chase had been busy picking up every box that fell off. Annata decided to carry one by hand instead. ‘Right, so where are we going Horace?’ Horace scratched his head and asked, ’Ariel, do you have any space left in the IT room?’ ‘Not with all the decorations and displays. The place is packed with visitors too.’ ‘And we need somewhere more permanent too…’ Horace mumbled. Permanent? Ariel thought, if he doesn’t want these, why not just throw them away? ‘What about the boathouse?’ Annata offered, keen to drop off her heavy package, ‘we have some space upstairs that no one has been using for a long time, I am sure the coach won’t object as well.’ Horace agreed, and the group started the scary descent on the slope to the riverside. They were forced to walk on the road as the pavement was not wide enough. ‘Sorry I didn’t come see the Computing Club,’ said Horace suddenly whilst struggling with the cargo, ‘it was a stressful morning.’ ‘It’s alright. This year seemed busier than last year’s.’ ‘Well, that’s one reason…’ ‘Eh? What do you mean?’ ‘We will explain later,’ said Annata, ‘let’s get there in one piece first with your Leaning Tower of Boxes on wheels!’ After a few close calls of almost slipping and letting go of the trolley, they finally arrived at the boathouse, where the Rowing Club was as busy as any other clubs, despite being not on campus. ‘Are you sure we can put our stuff here?’ asked Ariel, glaring at the athletes pushing their limits on their rowing machines. ‘Yes I am sure you can,’ Alya jumped out from nowhere, cheerful as always, ‘Annata texted me earlier, I already asked the coach.’ Horace and the others thanked her and picked up the boxes one by one. A steel staircase on the outside led to the balcony upstairs, which extended all the way to the entire width of the boathouse. Ariel had been wondering what the upstairs looked like since yesterday’s delivery with dad. The upstairs looked completely different from downstairs. Instead of a damp and cramped space like below, it was spacious with a nice wooden balcony and large windows. Inside, there were a few sofas and water sport magazines on the coffee table. Countless trophies and a few old oars where proudly displayed on the wall. ‘Why do you guys have so many boxes?’ Chase asked curiously, catching up from behind. ‘We have all sorts of things in there, scripts, ideas, schedules… things you need to run the club properly,’ answered Horace. ‘I suppose we can leave them in...’ Annata thought for a second, ‘Alya, can we leave these in that meeting room? I don’t think anyone uses it anymore.’ She pointed at a room next to the common area in the centre. It had a few chairs and a cabinet in it, with a viewing looking at the river, but looked deserted. ‘Yes… that should do nicely…’ Horace muttered. Alya gave a thumb-up and helped carrying them into room. The heavy boxes seemed as light as feathers when she carried them, making Ariel realised how capable the First Tier of the rowing team was. It did not take long until the last box had been set down, but the journey of handling an overloaded trolley downhill was more tiring than everyone thought, so they took a break on the sofas. ‘Why didn’t you take two trips?’ Alya asked confusedly. ‘Because real men take everything in one trip, ‘said Chase without a second thought. Annata put her hand up in protest. ‘You are as manly as we are Annata, this is a complement as high as I give to anyone!’ As expected, that complimented exchanged Annata’s smack on Chase’s head and everyone laughed. ‘Anyway,’ Horace stood up from the sofa, ‘thank you very much guys for helping me out. There was no way I could have carried those boxes by myself.’ ‘Can I ask something?’ said Ariel, ‘why did you say you need somewhere more “permanent” to put the boxes?’ Horace sighed lightly, he looked at Chase, who was also looking for answer. He then looked at Annata, who gave him a nod. ‘Sorry that I lied earlier. I didn’t want the people in the classroom hearing this,’ said Horace quietly, ‘the Debating Club is going to be shut down.’ ‘And the worse thing is,’ said Annata sternly, ‘the school is going to expel Horace. They are going to disband the club and kick Horace Pham out together.’"

      "text": "Countless visitors, students and teachers were passing through each other with their trays and lunches busily at the canteen. Each table was packed and filled with laughter, chit-chats, catching-ups and the sounds of the cutlery, except one. ‘Let me try to get this straight,’ said Chase, putting his palms over his face, ‘last month’s Debating Club conference at the town centre was too loud and disturbed many people’s sleeps, so some locals went to the school and filed a complaint against the Debating Club. One of them was at the conference opening and saw Horace on the stage speaking, so he pinned the responsibility on him.’ Annata nodded, ‘not only that. The school management thinks the club uses too much money, renting out the town hall and going abroad for competitions. They think the club’s a waste of money. More reason to order the club to disband.’ ‘But that makes no sense,’ argued Ariel, ‘you get your own budget for the club. Even if you spend a lot, it’s still your money. That has already been given to you. Also, Horace has nothing to do with this!’ ‘But that’s what they think,’ said Lu, who had met them at the canteen earlier, ‘someone saw Horace being on stage that night and thinks he’s leading the whole thing.’ Ariel still refused to believe this nonsense. Horace and he worked extremely hard back in primary school to get accepted into Central Pierra. Getting expelled over something like this was not only over the top, but he was not even responsible for those things. This is stupid and ridiculous! Somehow they pinned both things on him because someone saw Horace once at that one night? ‘What about your club president? What’s her name… Maula?’ said Chase. ‘She has been talking to the school secretly since we got the message.’ ‘And when did you get the message? That you were told of disbanding Debating Club?’ Lu thought for a second, ‘yesterday afternoon.’ ‘Then Horace told us that the principal was going to expel him,’ Annata added, ‘he was called in to the Principal’s office yesterday afternoon. The principal, however, told Horace that he could stay with the school until July next year because he has good grades. Then he’ll have to leave.’ ‘So, we need to do two things,’ Alya broke her silent and summarised, ‘one, stopping Debating Club from being disbanded. Two, stopping Horace from being expelled.’ ‘And they happened because of a few things. Firstly, the locals complained to the school about the noise and disturbance that night. Secondly, the Debating Club is spending too much money, whatever that means,’ said Ariel, tapping his finger on the table, ‘and thirdly, the school wanted someone to take that responsibility.’ ‘Well, of course the school didn’t say the last thing. It might have been what happened.’ ‘What’re you guys talking about?’ said Horace as he returned with half a dozen sandwiches. ‘You, of course! What they are doing to you is unbelievably unfair!’ ‘I really appreciate the thought guys, I really do,’ said Horace with a bitter smile, ‘I have thought about this the whole day, but I don’t want to get you guys in trouble.’ An awkward silence fell for a few seconds as everyone tried to come up with some ideas. ‘Still,’ said Chase firmly, ‘there is no way we can just accept that, because it’s wrong. You are innocent and they framed you.’ ‘Definitely,’ seconded Annata, ‘even if you are okay with the school falsely accusing you and kicking you out, did you forget how popular the Debating Club is? How many of them worked so hard to be part of it and make the club as famous as it is today? Do you just give up this easily?’ Lu nodded, ‘and you shouldn’t accept something that you never did. It was no one’s fault, we just need to make the school see that.’ Horace stared emptily at his ham and egg sandwich, and didn’t say a word. ‘But how?’ asked Ariel, ‘I think there’s more to this. The school has been overreacting way too much. They might have other reasons.’ ‘I don’t think so,’ said Lu, ‘even Mrs Kim is the new principal, she has always been quite nice and supportive to the Debating Club. Maybe we have indeed spent too much money and disturbed too many people that night. She was forced to make that decision.’ Ariel was still not convinced, but knowing there was no point dwelling on this with no proof, and he was not going to win an argument with a Debating Club member. ‘Anyway,’ said Annata, ‘what are we going to do?’ ‘They are already doing something, look!’ Lu put her iPhone on the table. Ariel had only seen one on TV after they just started selling it last week. She brought up a photo from a text message from one club member. In the secretly-taken picture, the club president Maula was talking to the principal in her office, presumably on the future of the club. ‘She’s always as quick as a bullet,’ said Horace, ‘but everyone, no matter what the real reason is. Whether we are spending too much money, being too loud during the conference that night, the school thinks I am responsible, someone framed me for the issues or there is some conspiracy going on, the important thing is, I don’t want you guys to get in trouble. If the school can somehow pin me on this, they can do the same to you just as easily.’ Suddenly, Annata stood up and slammed her hands on the table. Naturally, that caught the attention of everyone, including the table next to them. ‘That’s it,’ she said impatiently, ‘we are going nowhere. I hereby announce that we are forming the Debating Club and Horace rescue task force! We can’t rely Maula on doing everything, and she’s leaving the school soon for university entrance exams!’ ‘That’s right,’ said Chase confidently, ‘Horace, don’t worry about us getting in trouble. We will be regretting even more if we do nothing and watch you being framed. I know you are having a headache on how to deal with this quietly, but my headache is thinking how you are so calm about this.’ Ariel, Alya and Lu all agreed immediately. ‘Okay then, very well,’ said Horace, looking a little more hopeful now, ’we’ll save the Debating Club. If the club is saved, then I will probably be saved from being expelled too. I don’t know how, but we need to try.’ Annata proclaimed loudly, ‘absolutely! Let’s discuss on our operation plan on Monday. Alya, we can use that room where we left the boxes in the boathouse right?’ Alya said yes without hesitation. ‘Then we will meet on Monday in that room. That’s our war room now. Let’s finish off the Activities Fair today.’ Annata’s came-out-of-nowhere motivation and she took charge of the whole problem surprised Ariel a little. However, the real reason behind disbanding the club and kicking his friend out from the school is more than a few complains and numbers on an accounting book, but Annata was right, the group needed a sit-down to go over this. On the way back to the Computing Club, Maula and a few Debating Club members just walked out from the Principal’s office, looking angry and frustrated. They passed by Ariel without saying a word, like soldiers returning from the frontline. As Ariel watched them disappeared into the crowd, he felt an unexplainable pressure on his chest, realising how high of a mountain they were about to the climb. Two days later, everyone in class 2A was either celebrating the success of the Activities Fair, or recovering their bodies and throats from working too hard. The school bell signified the arrival of the lunch time. Normally, Alya would go to the canteen with her friends to buy whatever lunch set with the best value, or the most nutritious lunch, but today, she apologies to her friends for not going to lunch with them. She took out her lunchbox that was prepared last night, and dashed to the Rowing Club boathouse straight away. The wind had gotten stronger and colder. She had lost count of how many times she had walked on this slope that leads to the boathouse. The way down was always her favourite walk because the scent of the water got stronger with every step downslope. She could always look forward to a great rowing session every time she set foot on this road, but today was different. Instead of going into the boat storage, she went upstairs and straight into the meeting room where the others left their boxes of documents. She rarely came in here, the old carpet and mouldy smell made her a little uncomfortable, the fresh sea breeze was way more preferable. Annata was already there, who was drawing something on the whiteboard. The sight reminded Alya that time when her father brought her along to one of the Border Patrol Security Team briefing, where he worked as a security officer. She hadn’t seen her dad in a while now. ‘I knew you’d turn up first Alya,’ said Annata with a laugh, ‘being the quickest person in our club!’ ‘You know I am not the fastest rower,’ Alya smiled embarrassedly, ‘where are the others?’ Just at that moment, Ariel, Lu, Chase and mostly importantly, Horace walked in. He looked like he hadn’t slept for days. ‘Great timing,’ said Annata, ‘I am just finishing off here. Now that we’re all here, we can begin.’ ‘Question,’ said Chase as he put his hand up, ‘how are you so happy and energetic? We are not planning a birthday party. Do you have a great plan?’ ‘Well, well. My dad always says when you face a wall, you can complain and get upset, or you can smile and break through it.’ Horace nodded lightly. ‘I talked to Lu last night, and we came up with two plans to save the Debating Club. And I think if we can manage to save the club, with Horace leading it, the school won’t expel you anymore.’ ‘Wait… me?’ ‘Yes, you,’ Annata pointed at Horace, ‘if you save the club, everyone will see that you redeem yourself, so the school would have no reason to fire you anymore.’ ‘Okay, that sounds great, but what are we doing?’ asked Ariel curiously. ‘I am getting to it now, relax,’ Annata gestured him to take a deep breathe, and pointed at the scribbling on the whiteboard, ‘we need to do a petition. I think we need to prove to the school, especially the new principal, how popular the Debating Club really is. We must tell everyone that Horace is innocent as well. We will collect signatures at the school gate, classrooms, in other clubs for student signatures. Also, my mum’s friends are always saying how great the Debating Club is, so there must be some locals who also support the club! If we get a list of signatures of both the students, and the local residents, and then handing these to the school, there’s no way they can refuse to us.’ ‘I see,’ said Horace, ‘so we can use the students ‘signatures to prove how much of an impact of closing the club, and if we get enough local people’s signatures, we can sort of argue against the locals’ complain.’ ‘That’s right. And proving that you are not responsible for whatever they said, so that they can’t expel you. If the school still forces you out, there will be a riot!’ This is something we can do at least, Alya thought, but can we really make the school change its mind with pages of signatures? Not everyone is as passionate as we are. She glanced at Ariel, pondering the notion of something behind may be forcing the school to make this decision. ‘I think it sounds great,’ said Chase excitedly, ‘there’s no way the school would turn a blind eye to hundreds of signatures!’ ‘What about the money problem?’ asked Ariel, folding his arms and looked unconvinced, ‘even the school is convinced that the petition means many people support the club and the locals complained because of a spur of a moment, they could still say the club is using too much money.’ Lu put her hand up, ‘we were going to suggest a fund-raising event, like selling tickets to non-members to try out debating sessions with us, but Maula rejected that idea. She said it’s not ethical to sell the members’ skills like that.’ ‘So what can we do about that?’ ‘Nothing for now, Maula is working on that. She does the bookkeeping. She is also trying to take up responsibility of the club, but for unknown reasons, the school fixated on Horace being the culprit.’ Horace held his fists together like he was praying, but his eyes were filled with anger suddenly. Alya was quite sure this was the first time seeing the calm, cheerful Horace looking this angry. Annata picked up the marker pen and started writing on the board again, she must had picked up these briefing techniques from the coach. ‘Okay, so who’s doing what? We need to do a petition for both students and the locals. We can switch over later if we need to. I can help with both, I don’t mind’ ‘I will lead the school one,’ said Horace. ‘Same.’ said Lu. ‘I can start at my family’s noodle restaurant, I can deal with the locals, many of them are frequent customers!’ said Chase in full confidence. ‘Printing out flyers and putting them up downstairs could help too. I can do that.’ said Alya. ‘What about you, Ariel?’ ‘Umm… I can help Horace with the school petition,’ said Ariel slowly, ‘but I still think there’s more to this. Someone might be pulling strings behind or hates Horace so much that they want to kick him out.’ ‘You are still on that?’ asked Lu disapprovingly. ‘Yeah, there’s something that has been bugging me. Just before I came to the Debating Club room on Saturday, I ran into Vito from our class. He doesn’t like Debating Club too much because it’s competing with his Drama Club, and he knew the club was in trouble at that time.’ ‘How did he know?’ ‘That’s what I was wondering, even the others club members didn’t know the disbandment that day. I want to look into this, do some investigation and digging around. Maybe Vito is related to this, or maybe he heard it from someone else, but someone else knows what going on. I think we need to know who are we fighting against, and prove Horace’s innocence that way if I can find proof that he is framed.’ The others looked amazed, perhaps they had always thought Ariel just preferred some conspiracy theories, but now the situation as complex as unravelling a ball of string. Ariel might be onto something. ‘It makes sense, but...’ said Annata hesitantly, ‘do you have time to do the petition? We need all the help to save the club.’ ‘I am OK with it, I want to help Horace clearing his name,’ said Ariel firmly, ‘I cannot watch and see the school slandering my friend and framing him!’ ‘We are all on the same boat here, Horace,’ said Chase as he turned to Horace, ‘do you have some photos of the club and yourself? We will need those for our petition.’ Horace walked to the pile of boxes quietly, he pulled out one of them and started looking through it. His sluggish movements, worn-out expression and endless sighs made everyone looked at him worriedly. The past two days must have been extremely stressful on him. He kicked a box by mistake, and the column of boxes tumbled down like dominos. Luckily Annata moved out of the way just before they landed on her. Soon, papers and dust were flying everywhere in the room like snowfall. ‘Dammit… dammit… DAMMIT!’ Horace screamed desperately whilst pulling his hair. He kneeled on the ground, looking very much in pain. Everyone was stunned to see him like this, especially Lu, whose mouth was wide open like a tunnel. ‘Horace… you… you okay?’ Chase approached carefully. ‘Yeah… yeah… I am fine, sorry about that,’ Horace said shakenly, sitting on the floor with a photo album in his hands. He looked like a scared little child hiding out in the rain. ‘I didn’t realise how serious this was when I first heard it. After I got called in to Mrs Kim’s office, I thought it was a joke, or a dream,’ said Horace slowly, ‘until I told Lu and saw how she reacted, it finally dawned on me how screwed I am!’ ‘My family doesn’t have a lot of money, we have been relying on mum’s part time job after… after dad was fired. My little sister is about to enter secondary school. This is the only school in Pierra that has scholarship. The… the other three schools are either expensive private schools or… charging stupid money for books and equipment... We can’t afford it. I can’t afford it,’ Horace confessed, pale as a sheet of paper, ‘I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO!’ He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. ‘And I was even angrier at them on closing the Debating Club. The school is destroying everything I’ve worked for! Things that everyone in the club has worked for! And Mrs Kim says it’s my fault,’ he looked up to meet everyone’s eyes, tears finally ran from the corners of his eyes, ‘it wasn’t my fault, was it?’ Annata, Alya, Lu, Ariel and Chase gathered around the poor Horace. Ariel stepped forward and reassured him with a soft pat on his shoulder. ‘Remember how we studied like madmen in primary school?’ said Ariel, ‘we always wanted to get into Central Pierra. You told me this is the only place where people like you or me could show our true potential, because school clubs and teams are the more important than studying here. And now, we’re here and you’ve done your best at the Debating Club. I don’t think no one else could see how far you’ve come. If the others can see it, if your club members can see it, if we can see it, we can certainly make the school see it too. It will be their lost for losing you.’ Chase sat down next to Ariel, looking at Horace sternly. ‘Ariel’s right, I know you are under a lot of pressure, but it’s too early to give in.’ Horace kept quiet for a moment, still tucking in his head between his arms, but he wasn’t shaking anymore. He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. Alya wondered if the boys’ words had comforted him or the deep breathe did the trick. Nevertheless, it must have taken Horace a great deal of courage to show this side of his. He stood up slowly and met everyone’s eyes with his familiar smile, although there were still traces of tears at the corner of his eyes. ‘Thank you for being with me Ariel, Chase, and everyone,’ said Horace, ‘the night I got back home after the Activities Fair, I told my mum and my sister about this after dinner… my mum blew up, she was really panicking and nearly dropped the plates on the floor. Subconsciously I was probably thinking mum and dad might have something up their sleeves, but at that moment I realised there was no second trick. I felt like I am a bird flying in a thunderstorm alone and the wind is forcing me into a hard wall, fast.’ Horace took another breath to calm down a little more. ‘That was until today, when I saw you guys are here, offering to help. I don’t feel so lost anymore.’ The room seemed to have become brighter. Alya looked back to see an array of sunlight shooting through the dense grey clouds, down on to the River Perryson. The gusty wind had finally calmed down as well. ‘We are going to make it,’ smiled Alya, ‘you will be alright, Horace. There’s always sunlight after each storm.’"

      "chapterTitle": "Chapter 7 – Signature, Signature, Signature",
      "text": "Since that fateful weekend of the Activities Fair, even Chase had noticed that Debating Club meets had been much more difficult than before, despite not being a club member. They used to meet up every day, literally, on the weekend as well, like one of those university professors devoting their lives to one research. They would take up one of the largest classrooms – usually on the third floor of the second teaching building – and do their debating. Now, for the last five weeks, the student council always hesitated when approving a room use request. Cowards, thought Chase, they just want something to look good even applying to universities and colleges. They don’t care about us. From what Lu and Horace told him, Maula had done an impressive job on persuading Mrs Kim to allow Debating Club to keep running until end of school year. She deserves to be the club president, winning against Mrs like that. Chase yawned, but the freezing air attacked his throat like a blade, he coughed violently for nearly half a minute after that. ‘Are you a moron?’ laughed Annata, ‘it seems you still forgot how cold today is after standing here for the entire morning?’ ‘Shut up. I’m just not in my best shape today.’ Chase wished the petition had gone as well as they’d hoped for. Gathering signatures and watching the list slowly filled up was a painfully long process. Despite the large banner saying Save the Central Pierra Debating Club!! and Help Keeping Our Friend With Us – STOP OUR SCHOOL FROM EXPELING HIM, they only had fifty-six signatures from the public so far. The winds blew harder than usual today, so Chase tucked his hands in his coat. ‘Hey Annata,’ said Chase, ‘are there ways to get more signatures… quicker?’ ‘What are you proposing? You already did that loudspeaker rally thing and that embarrassing stand-up drama near the fountain last few weekends. They clearly don’t work Chase. I was so embarrassed that I had to hide in the supermarket.’ ‘My ideas actually worked quite well if you remember Annata,’ protested Chase, ‘the crowd was about to sign on that sheet until the police came unplug my speaker.’ Annata giggled. ‘I love that bit though. You were screaming like a kid after his video game got taken away.’ ‘I was probably reported by the same people who went to the school to complain about Horace.’ Annata didn’t reply this time, she mind seemed to have wandered off miles away again. It felt wrong to make her say something, so Chase continued looking for passer-by in the park. Pierra District Park wasn’t too far away from the school and slightly further away from Pierra Rectangle. Many locals and students walked through the park in the morning to get to the workplace or the school. Likewise, the grandpas and grandmas tended to stroll in the park for countless laps since dawn, making this the perfect spot to get signatures from unsuspecting strangers. The park had nothing out of ordinary, except a concrete football field that was painted with dark red to mark its boundary, which was affectionately known as the ‘Red Field’ by most students at school. Today, of course, there was hardly anyone in the park except the school football team practising on the Red Field, who had already signed Horace’s school petition. Another cold breeze blew over, Chase and Annata shivered at the same time. ‘We are catching a cold already,’ said Chase, ‘if we stay a bit longer we will get pneumonia.’ ‘You’re weaker than you look Chase,’ replied Annata with a surprise, ‘if you’re really that cold, go home and grab a jacket. I’m not leaving until we get more signatures today.’ ‘But there’s hardly anyone! It’s almost Christmas and people are probably staying home or going on holiday already.’ ‘Don’t speak too soon, look!’ Annata pointed at an old man with a walking stick, slowly coming towards them. Chase couldn’t tell if he was just passing by or he wanted to speak with them. It didn’t matter, because Annata was already running to him with the list and a pen. Chase hurriedly followed. ‘Hello Sir! Can you help us signing this petition? We are students from the Central Pierra Secondary School. They are trying to disband our debating club because of noise disturbance one night and they want to expel our friend for it, but he was framed. Can you please help us save our friend and our club?’ The old man stopped, but didn’t say a word. He looked at Annata and Chase with a smile, and his eyes were nearly closed so Chase wondered if he was really looking at them. ‘Well,’ said the old man with a crackling voice, ‘if you did disturb the others, wouldn’t you say it’s fair to take responsibility?’ ‘You are right,’ replied Chase, ‘we’ve already met with the Head of Pierra Affairs and several residents almost several weeks ago and gave our apologies to them. It was a one-off event and they have kindly accepted our apologies, but the school still insisted on the club would disturb the town, so we are doing a petition to prove that the people don’t think that. And on top of that, they are making our friend Horace to take responsibility of it and want to expel him.’ ‘I see,’ said the old man, who didn’t move an inch even after the cold breeze just then, ‘and why do you think your friend isn’t responsible?’ ‘Because he was only a club member,’ answered Annata, ‘and all he has been doing is guiding the younger students into debates. He…’ ‘Alright,’ interrupted the old man. He slowly turned to look at the school, which was just visible between the houses next the park. Another chilling wind blew over, only this was the strongest one yet. Chase nearly lost his balance. How on earth does this old man just stand there like nothing? ‘He’s lucky to have you. True friends help each other out without asking anything back,’ he continued, ‘I’m not sure what happened, and I don’t know who your friend is. By the sound of this, he sounds like a good lad.’ ‘He is,’ said Annata, ‘and we are doing what we can to help him.’ ‘I can see that,’ laughed the old man, ‘standing here in the cold for a few signatures… don’t worry, you can have mine.’ He took the pen from Annata and Chase held the writing board for him. Despite his age, Chase could feel his immense strength when he signed his name, strong but fluid. This man is incredible! ‘Thank you very much!’ Annata and Chase bowed together to him. ‘Don’t mention it. There’s some bad weather coming, and you should stay together to walk it through.’ The old man smiled and continued his journey, ‘Just like we did,’ he added quietly. Several hours later, it was still very quiet, as if it was the middle of the night. Mr Tam the corner butcher and Mrs Evans the bookstore owner walked by and happily signed the sheet. ‘That is just outrageous!’ said Mrs Evans whilst furiously scribbling her name down. She went on for nearly half an hour on how things like this wouldn’t happen in the good old days, and now the world has turned into ‘an unfair pile of mess’. Unfortunately, many just ignored them and hurried home. Who wanted to stand around to listen to two Grade 2 students in the cold anyway? Annata checked the signing sheet and it said a disappointing grand total of fifty-nine signatures. ‘How many do we need?’ asked Chase after returning from jogging around the Red Field for the tenth lap, but still couldn’t warm up enough to stand around comfortably. ‘The student council did say we need at least 500 public signatures,’ said Annata, ‘and more than 2/3 of the student body to sign this.’ ‘We won’t be getting the rest of the 441 signatures today Annata. Come on, let’s go! I’ve had enough of this cold.’ ‘We should drop by the school first,’ said Annata as she finally started packing the things, ‘I know it’s a Saturday, but Horace and the others are probably still at school getting signatures.’ Chase delightedly joined her in folding the petition banner and putting the posters away. ‘How do you they are still there? They are probably long gone.’ ‘How do you know they are probably long gone?’ said Annata, ‘let’s go to the school first.’ Chase folded the outdoor table and carried it with his arm. Great, he thought, I swear I am gonna die of exhaustion or hypothermia after today. * * * ‘Thank you for your support!’ said Horace as bowed slightly towards the members of the Music Club with Lu and Alya. ‘Don’t mention it! You guys at Debating Club rock! And we need you at this school Horace, you can’t go!’ ‘I appreciate it,’ said Horace, feeling a little embarrassed, ‘we love your concerts as well!’ ‘Great to have you guys as our fans,’ said one of the boys, he brushed the strings of his guitar lightly as if to compliment his appreciation, ‘we will see you in our next concert a’right? We’ve got to practice our new song!’ ‘Of course, thanks again for the signatures!’ Alya pulled out the club list and ticked off the Music Club after the door was closed. The paper was already crumbled, but it was already filled with signatures of a few dozen students. ‘Okay, which one are we going next?’ ‘Let’s see…’ Alya took out the list of school clubs and teams, which she had been using as a checklist for the last few weeks. ‘We have just done the Music Club… Cooking Club already signed… Science Club still didn’t want to… Drama Club still haven’t signed yet.’ ‘Cool. Let’s go then.’ As the group made their way to the assembly hall, where the club usually rehearses on weekends, Lu suddenly remembered something. ‘Ehhh, hey guys, didn’t Ariel say something about something strange about Vito the other day?’ suggested Lu, ‘should we try somewhere else? I think Vito is with the Drama Club.’ Alya thought for a second. ‘Well, there’s no harm trying. We will ask them nicely. If they sign the petition, great day! If they don’t, we will just move on to the next.’ Lu agreed but unconvinced. When they finally got to the ground floor, Horace suggested for a break at the canteen. As usual, he immediately volunteered to buy them drinks. ‘He’s just so nice. Horace doesn’t get a lot of pocket money but still buys us stuff,’ said Alya, then she leaned forward and whispered to Lu, ‘don’t you think so?’ Lu jumped slightly from her seat, nearly bumping into Alya’s head. ‘What? Yeah… yeah… yeah sure! He’s… quite nice… indeed.’ Oh dear. Alya sat back and enjoyed the sight of the flustered Lu for a moment, but before she could make any more suggestive enquiries, Lu’s phone started ringing. Great timing! She swiftly answered the call. Alya looked more interested in her smartphone than the conversation. It turned out it was Annata, who was just checking if they were still at school after collecting signatures for half a day, but at least they were on the way now. By the sound of it, Annata wasn’t too happy with Chase’s slacking off. ‘Annata and Chase are on their way here,’ said Lu as she put her mobile phone back in her pocket, but Alya appeared still had her eyes fixed on it. ‘That’s a very different phone! Why doesn’t it have any buttons?’ ‘Well, it’s a new thing. They called it smartphones,’ Lu took it back out to show it to Alya, ‘my dad knew a friend who sells computers and stuff… so he managed to get one iPhone for each of us.’ ‘Wow! It looked so different,’ said Alya, taking out her flip phone, ‘maybe I will get one after getting a part-time job a few years later.’ Lu felt a little embarrassed, she wasn’t too comfortable showing things that she owned simply because she was the daughter of a successful businessman. Seeing her friends had to work much harder than she did always made her feel guilty about her background. ‘There you go! One lemonade no sugar, and one grape jelly soda juice.’ Horace sat down two cans of soft drinks gently. He probably had bought enough food and drinks for his friends to act like a proper waiter now. ‘What are you guys talking about?’ Horace realised he interrupted some sort of conversations between the girls. ‘Just Annata and Chase are on their way now.’ Luckily Alya didn’t dwell on that. ‘Oh? Where are they?’ ‘They were just at the park, so I guess they are… twenty minutes away?’ answered Lu. The first sip of the lemonade sent a shiver down Lu’s spine, maybe this seemingly good choice wasn’t too ideal after all in this cold weather. She glanced at the hot chocolate available for the same price at the vending machine. Maybe I should’ve gone with that. After the break, they continued towards the Drama Club. They were standing out like a bonfire in the night, by looking for the source of the echoes of the dramatic dialogues, deafening laughter and endless footsteps, it took the group minutes to find the room where they were practising. Alya cracked open the door, then completely opened it. ‘Hello, excuse me!’ She said loudly but politely at the crowd of people in costumes. One student with a clipboard ran to them. ‘We are rehearsing for the Christmas show here. You guys shouldn’t be here!’ ‘Please, can we have a minute? We ar…’ Horace voiced up. ‘No you can’t,’ the student with the clipboard already grew impatient, ‘you are disturbing our actors and actresses here. Everyone in the school, including Mrs Kim, is expecting us to put on a good show, so please leave.’ Lu was about to chip in as well, but Horace stopped her, shaking his head lightly. Although the actors and actresses were dressed in fancy medieval costumes, they seemed to be on a break at least, talking and joking with each other. Some of them were sharing snacks, playing on their phones. The backstage students with black T-shirts and the word “Crew” on their backs were equally not busy. The only person looked intense was the person in front of them. ‘Can I ask you to leave again? We are very busy and on a tight schedule here.’ ‘Hold on Alex! Don’t worry. I know these people.’ Lu looked over his shoulders to see a boy with stylish hair walking towards them, smiling and waving at them. ‘Hey Vito, how are you doing?’ said Horace friendlily, but Lu could sense he tensed up a little. Vito Lanker… is he the person what Ariel suspected being the culprit? Although Lu just couldn’t see how another student could accomplish such a plot against another student, nor she saw any reason to, especially coming from a somewhat friendly smile. It’s just some conspiracy Ariel dreamed up. ‘I’m very well, thanks,’ said Vito, ‘how can I help you ladies and gentleman?’ Horace explained the situation like he did for countless times. Vito looked interested. He seemed very nice and friendly to me, Lu thought, what’s Ariel’s problem? After learning what they were asking for, Vito touched his chin lightly, and paced around a few steps. The dramatic response looked pretty comical to Lu, she nearly let out a chuckle. However, it was Vito who chuckled first. He stopped his pacing abruptly. ‘Okay, I see what’s going on,’ said Vito slowly, ‘this is very unfair on you guys. No problem, you have my support.’ He took the clipboard and took out an expensive-looking fountain pen from his inner jacket pocket. A signature was swift signed on their list. ‘Thank you very much!’ Lu found her chance to voice up. ‘Don’t mention it. Debating Club is such an… important and iconic part of our school isn’t it? So wouldn’t I sign?’ ‘Because you said so the other day!’ A couple of older-looking students overheard their conversation and came over, angrily, pretty much stomping their feet. ‘I remember you guys,’ said one of them with a blue overall costume, ‘Horace and you two girls came to us to beg for the school for keeping you. That’s funny and sad at the same time. Don’t you have some dignity?’ Horace fought back. ‘We are trying to prove a point to the school, to Mrs Kim, that we…’ ‘We know, the whole school knows,’ interrupted the student, ‘they said you screwed up that night by making a racket in the Town Hall, also spending every penny out of the school’s pocket, Horace. Now the entire school knows who you are, you are a celebrity now.’ Lu glanced at Horace, who was shaking slightly from anger. His eyes were screaming “it wasn’t my fault”, but he kept silent. Suddenly, Alya stepped forward, standing quite close to the sneering seniors, completely ignoring their intimidation. ‘That was extremely unfair,’ protested Alya, ‘Horace did nothing wrong and the school management simply wanted to someone to take the fall to protect their reputation. The others said that because the school said that. Have a little think, guys, why would he get such a severe punishment when he was just doing club activities like they have been doing for years? The same might happen to the Drama Club, you know.’ They were slightly surprised by Alya’s aggressiveness, but not convinced. ‘I think you just answered your own question,’ said another senior in a green overall, ‘nevertheless, Debating Club has been taking members from us recently, so why would we sign this petition at all?’ He finished off with a stare at Vito, who had been warmly smiling back with his hands in the pocket. ‘Well… why shouldn’t I? Debating Club is the competition for us, but having them around again will push us to do even better.’ Vito explained with a shrug. Lu didn’t expect someone in the Drama Club would be supportive at all. They have been dubbed the “Queen of Clubs” and everyone knew about how they contend to get the top spot light. Lu heard that joining the Drama Club is easier than Debating Club because of their screening process, but having the brightest students like Horace around means they could consistently put on a good show, and that is something that they could be envy about. The others looked at Vito sceptically. Then they turned to Horace, standing inches from him to be intimidating. ‘I don’t know what Vito is planning, but we are not signing this thing, and I couldn’t care less if the school kicks you out tomorrow. For all we care, you and your club can get the hell out any minute.’ As soon as they finished, Vito and the others went back to the practice. ‘What’s their problem? They are going to stand by and watch this? What a bunch of dummies, if this happened to us, it will happen to them too,’ said Lu angrily as they left the room. ‘Well, they made their minds up ages ago, Lu,’ said Alya, ‘we can’t do much to change that.’ So it’s a heavy loss, they have the most students members in this school. ‘Alya is right, they’ve been in the game for too long,’ added Horace, ‘this school is pushing everyone hard to do well in their clubs. Everyone is so competitive that they’d do anything to get to the top. We aren’t friends or schoolmates to them. We are the walls that stand between them and the number one of this world we are in.’ What’s the point in making it the top after burning every bridge in your path? Alya pondered worriedly. ‘Running into a little obstacle are we?’ Chase jumped out suddenly from behind a pillar. Lu and Alya screamed in surprise. ‘What are you doing?’ Annata appeared from the same pillar and gave Chase a smack in the head. Horace admitted that the Drama Club refused to sign except Vito. ‘This is nothing. We stood in the town centre and at the park for four hours whilst freezing to death and we barely had three signatures.’ Annata shouted, looking incredibly frustrated. ‘How could you say that so proudly? This is not a competition to see who suffered the most! Sorry everyone, it was really quiet today, we didn’t have enough progress.’ As usual Horace was being very understanding. ‘Did you see us talking to them just now?’ ‘Yes we were peeking through the door gaps, and Chase here wanted to jump scare you.’ ‘Why did you hide behind that pillar with me then?’ Chase giggled. ‘Anyway, that wasn’t important,’ Annata changed the subject swiftly, ‘so most of the Drama Club don’t want to help, and I think we expected that.’ ‘What I didn’t expect what Vito actually signed,’ added Chase. ‘Indeed,’ said Lu, ‘within the Drama Club, I think Vito is someone we can trust.’ * * * Vito is NOT someone we can trust! Ariel nearly jumped from his chair when Vito appeared in a photograph from a public company’s press release online. The article titled “Lanker Airlines is pleased to announce new routes to Vladokich, Zentrum Union” resonated perfectly with Vito’s smile in the group of men in suits, next to him was his father, the company’s boss Vitus Lanker, and Ariel could swear his soul that he knew that face, and he’d just seen it too. But from where? Ariel hated this feeling. It felt like going through a pile of scattered photographs in his head, only it was made murkier by the tiredness. Where did I see him? He tapped on the desk rapidly without even realising it. It felt an itch deep inside that he couldn’t scratch. ‘Oh! Isn’t he one of the men who complained to the school with the town people?’ asked Pavel curiously. Oh of course! Ariel wanted to slap himself in the face for forgetting such an important piece of information. Pavel had been helping him tirelessly to investigate Vito’s background since the others started the petition, and today was no exception. He brought up a photograph that was secretly taken by Pavel’s friend when Mr Lanker and the others came to the Principal’s office to see Mrs Kim and Mr Hong and filed a complaint against the Debating Club, making to school deciding that the club was spending too much and somehow Horace needed to take the fall. This was now something that the entire school knew about, but Ariel explained to Pavel that on the day of Activities Fair, that Vito somehow knew about the school’s intention before it went public. Now, that connection was finally made. ‘We did it Pavel!’ screamed Ariel excitedly, ‘we found it! This is it! This is why Vito knew about what they are doing to Horace so early on!’ Pavel looked a little shocked from Ariel’s cheer. ‘Okay… but what does this mean? How is this going to help?’ ‘Simple. We knew Vito comes from a rich family and he knew the school’s next move, but now we know why he knew that as well. Look,’ said Ariel as he took out the school monthly newsletter from last week, ‘Vito’s dad also is with the PTA – Parents Teacher Association –, the PTA funds the school on many things, like classrooms, equipment, stuff like that. That’s how every club got their new equipment, because the parents wanted their kids to have good stuff.’ ‘Okay, but how does that help the Debating Club and … erm…Horace?’ ‘We now know who we are actually fighting against. It may not be the school after all. I think the school needs their money, so Mrs Kim needs to do what Vito’s dad says.’ Pavel looked at Ariel emptily. Just when Ariel was about to carry on, Horace and the others came in to the computing room, looking as if they had just walked across the Sahara desert. Ariel excitedly reported he was just found, and secretly hoping that would cheer the four of them up, but disappointingly, there were nothing but disappointed faces and sighs. ‘That’s it? We went through the entire town and every floor of the school, and this is what you have? Vito’s photo and a story you made up?’ challenged Annata, who appeared to be using every ounce of her energy to hold back a punch. ‘But wait, think about what this means,’ defended Ariel, ‘I think I was wrong about Mrs Kim – she was forced to disband Debating Club because someone made her, and that someone is Vito’s dad, Vitus.’ ‘You already said that, so what?’ ‘This is the what, Annata,’ continued Ariel, feeling a little displeased from the lack of appreciation, ‘I think Vito’s dad complained to the school because Vito asked his dad to do so, because he doesn’t like the Debating Club and Horace’s getting all the attention. We know how he is the type that wanted attention.’ Horace was taken aback for a moment. Knowing him for all these years, Ariel knew that the idea of leaving this school had just haunted him again. Chase turned to Pavel, leaning on his shoulders with both arms. ‘What do you think young lad? Ariel said you have been a great help,’ said Chase cheerfully. ‘Uhh, uhhh, well,’ said Pavel, overwhelmed and surprised by Chase, who was pulled back by Annata already, ‘I don’t really know what’s going on… but I think what Ariel says… makes sense if Vito has always been jealous.’ ‘Thank you Pavel,’ said Alya, ‘I believe finding all this is not easy, so well done on this detective work!’ ‘What about me?’ asked Ariel. ‘Well done to you too, but you’ve been doing this for a long time, so… still well done but… less well?’ Horace let out a laugh. ‘So then, what does that all mean then?’ ‘This means we don’t need to change Mrs Kim or Mr Hong’s minds, or even going through all that petition or pleading. We just need to talk to Mr Lanker here.’ ‘You think he will talk with us? ‘He’s a businessman, he’ll negotiate.’ ‘But how do you explain this then?’ said Lu, holding up the petition signing sheet, ‘we literally just talked to Vito fifteen minutes ago. Everyone at the Drama Club was quite horrible to us, but he was the only one from the Drama Club who signed this!’ Lu walked even closer to Ariel, looking almost threatening now. Ariel wondered if Lu had been disagreeing with him for so long that she finally ran out of patience to confront him here and now, but at the same time, Ariel thought he must be hearing this wrong. ‘So… why would he help us if he’s behind all this?’ Hundreds of possibilities flew by in Ariel’s head like cars on a highway, but none of them made any sense. Maybe he was bluffing? Maybe it was just Vito’s dad planning it all and Vito doesn’t know about it? Maybe Vito regretted what he did in the first place but too embarrassed to back down? ‘Ariel?’ Horace asked concernedly, noticing Ariel had frozen up for longer than few moments. ‘Eh…’ Ariel hated being speechless, because it wasn’t only embarrassing, it also showed that all that effort in the last few weeks was also on the verge of going out of the window. ‘I think…’ Pavel voiced up, ‘I think Vito pretended to support. The rest of the Drama Club didn’t put their names down, so one more name wouldn’t help much.’ ‘No, every name helps,’ Lu insisted, ‘we needed 2/3 of the student body, which is 600 signatures.’ ‘I don’t know why he signed,’ admitted Ariel, ‘but this can’t be a coincidence. Vito’s not a nice person, and he will do whatever he can take Horace out! Can’t you see?!’ ‘No I can’t.’ ‘Then look harder!’ Ariel realised how worked up he’d gotten. As soon as he finished, every friend that stood before him looked at him like they had just witnessed a crime. For a brief second, he felt like a stranger had taken over his body, ranting and shouting at his friends over something that’s so trivial. What’s wrong with me? Ariel apologised quietly. Chase offered to go back to the town to appeal for more signatures before the short winter day finished, and soon the group left without saying another word to Ariel. Horace was the last to leave. ‘I know you and Pavel worked very hard on this, but…’ ‘I am just trying to help you.’ ‘I know, but still…’ Horace continued, ‘maybe you are right, maybe he’s lying, but don’t let your hate for him made you see what you wanted to see, please.’ Ariel looked at Horace firmly. ‘I am not.’ ‘That’s fine then. I am sure they will forget about this very soon.’ Ariel paused for a second. ‘Hey Horace, just before you leave… I found out something last month, on… Lu.’ ‘What about her?’ ‘You know my dad’s workshop? The one next to our house and where he works?’ ‘Yes of course, we used to hide behind the shelfs and play games there, until you mum found out and shouted at us.’ Ariel smiled. ‘Yep, and that’s our family business basically. We… we were in a bit of a tight spot a few years ago when they opened a new boathouse by the port. It took away our customers. Just before we ran out of money, some rich businessman from the capital came to offered to buy my dad’s business.’ Horace listened quietly. ‘And I found that Lu’s dad is that businessman.’ Horace raised his eyebrows. ‘Wow… small world isn’t it? So, shouldn’t you be extremely grateful to Lu? It doesn’t seem like it.’ ‘I would be. If I hadn’t found out her dad opened that new boathouse by the port in the first place and put us in that situation. Her dad practically forced us to sell the business!’ ‘I see… but it’s her father. It has nothing to do with her. Are you disagreeing with her because of this?’ ‘No, of course not. It’s just… I don’t trust her very much.’ A text broke their train of thought abruptly. The others were waiting downstairs and told Horace to hurry up. After Horace finally left, the room echoed with nothing but the cooling fans buzzing and occasional wind noises through the window gaps. Ariel collapsed on to his chair, staring at the press release he was so eager to show ten minutes ago emptily. The smile on Vito’s face on that photo was the most revolting thing he’d ever seen. He was tearing that photo into a million pieces in his mind. You’ve got to be behind this. You are the one who lied to the school and hurt my friend. ‘I think you are right though,’ said Pavel quietly. Ariel looked at him surprisedly. He didn’t expect Pavel would still be on his side after that lash-out. ‘There’re too much coincidences to call this a coincidence,’ he continued, ‘I think we need to look deeper.’ Ariel agreed, but quietly let out a heavy sigh. He looked out from the window of the Computing Room. The streets looked paler than in the summer, and dry yellow leaves spiralling uncontrollably in the basketball court. On the far side, beyond the river, the outline of Zentrum Union was still as mysterious as ever. Ariel wondered if someone in that secret land would also looked back at them. The one thing for sure was, Ariel could never see the full picture from this end. Horace, Chase, Annata, Lu and Alya made their way through the school gate. Despite the unusually cold weather, they looked happy. Ariel wondered what they were talking about. Where to go next? How funny that old man was from the Pierra Rectangle park? Or, how Ariel was actually an idiot? Finally, he looked at his own reflection from the slightly dirty window. Here I am, back to just myself… again. And the worse thing is, he was questioning himself too."

      "chapterTitle": "Chapter 8 – The Meetup",
      "text": "Annata was sure that the minute hand on the classroom wall clock was broken. Miss Swanson, who was also class 2B’s homeroom teacher, had a reputation of being kind and down-to-earth with everyone, but also infamously bad at keeping history classes concise. Especially when you’re in a hurry. Annata’s mind had already drifted away like the lumps of stormy clouds, which were preparing for a gigantic storm. Echoes of the thunder continued to shake the classroom lightly. ‘…and as a result, Zentrum Union signed the Perryson Protocol with Pyon. The protocol was, of course, named after the river that separates us from them. For decades, many more trade deals were signed as Zentrum Union’s economy grew from their crops and manufacturing industry…’ Annata glanced at Alya’s empty seat. It was clean and tidy, with only one textbook stowed under the desk. Although this school had been boosting its club and sport activities, it still had to do some academic teachings. Right now, everyone was preparing for the winter test, which was in two weeks’ time. What’s the point of studying? We don’t need half of this stuff when we graduate and get a job. All activities were suspended for the test, except those in the First division of the sports team, like Alya, were allowed to continue practising instead of studying, because it “would be beneficial to their future endeavours”. If only I was in the First division of rowing team as well… Looking a few more rows across, Chase was even more bored than Annata. He’d been fidgeting with his left hand, spinning his pen with is right hand, and making the third paper aeroplane under the desk. However, knowing Chase, he probably wasn’t bored because the lesson was boring, but because he knew all of the stuff in the book already. ‘…Zentrum Union was slowing recovering from the war for the last three decades as a resul-’ ‘Sorry Miss Swanson!’ Lu suddenly raised her hand. The normally shy Lu seemed to have run out of patience too. ‘The bell rang twenty minutes ago, can we please go now?’ she asked firmly. ‘Ah! Umm… okay.’ Miss Swanson checked the broken wall clock against her wristwatch, but clearly that didn’t work. ‘Don’t forget your umbrella and your homework! And study for the test everyone.’ The stand-up-bow formality was completed hurriedly and casually after she finally said the class was dismissed. Then everyone rushed to the door like escaping a fire. A lightning flashed the entire classroom, followed by an immediate deafening thunder as if the ground was breaking in half. A few girls screamed loudly and some boys laughed in response. ‘Library?’ Chase suggested, he looked like he’d just been released from jail. ‘No,’ Annata denied immediately, ‘even if we are studying, we need to do it at our base.’ Lu looked worried. ‘What if the school finds out we are still doing the petition during the revision period? We’d get in trouble!’ As they packed up and left, the dark clouds were rumbling. Thunders kept pounding from afar, but it still hadn’t rained yet. ‘We need to run!’ As the three dashed round the hallway, Annata looked back to see if the others had caught up with her and her athletic abilities, but that was a mistake, because she’d bumped into someone hard. She fell onto the ground and rolled several times. When she finally came to a stop, and was relieved that she didn’t hit her head, she carefully opened her eyes to prepare for a huge round of scolding. Instead, the first thing she saw was a camera lens. ‘Ow… ow… ow…’ the camera guy looked like to be in huge pain, but he immediately turned his attention to his camera, which was being protected in his arms. ‘Are you okay?’ as Lu helped Annata up, Chase checked on the other person, ‘wait… I know you! You are that cameraman from the Debating Club conference!’ ‘Dude, I have a name,’ muttered the older-looking student, ‘I’m Lee. Not that anyone remembers the cameraman’s name.’ ‘I’m so, so sorry, Lee,’ Annata apologised immediately, ‘are you hurt?’ ‘No worries. The important thing is, my camera is alright.’ Lee said as he caressed the camera as if it was his little baby. Lu looked at him in disgust. ‘Again, sorry for running into you.’ Annata said as he helped him up. ‘What’re you taking pictures of? There are no competitions or shows today. Everyone is revising for the tests,’ said Chase. ‘I’m the president of the Documentary Photography Club, and dude, I must do my duty to record the reality and everything’s going on at school.’ ‘I’ve never heard of the Documentary Photography Club,’ challenged Lu, ‘is that the same as the school newspaper or the Media Club?’ Lee seemed saddened, a look that Annata was trying to forget since that strange encounter with this strange guy on that evening. ‘Shame that you haven’t heard of us, we are more realistic than they are. Those guys like… saying what they like saying on films and newsletters.’ ‘So what exactly are you doing today?’ Chase asked again impatiently. ‘Well… uh… you know… how well students are preparing for exams and revising…’ ‘Can I borrow this?’ Lu grabbed his camera and started going through the photos despite Lee’s protest. It didn’t take long for them to see photos of themselves chatting in the classroom, Annata dozing off in the History Class, Chase making paper aeroplanes, and a few other students that Annata didn’t know revising in the library. Then, some more photos on them appealing for signatures at the school gate and in the park. Lu was so upset that she nearly smashed the camera onto the ground, before Chase pulling her back. ‘We told you that you CANNOT take photos of people without them agreeing first! Do you have no respect for privacy?’ screamed Lu, face bright red. Annata thought steam was about to puff out from her ears and nose. ‘Dude, I understand…’ ‘I am a girl!’ ‘Sorry,’ Lee stammered, ‘but this is what documentary is all about. It wouldn’t be real if I had asked your permission first. Also, I believe another guy told me not use to flash, rather than asking first.’ ‘You remember wrong,’ said Chase calmly, ‘and this felt more like paparazzi than documentary.’ ‘Exactly! DELETE!’ Lu furiously pressed the button with the rubbish bin icon as Lee screamed in pain. Suddenly, an idea sparkled in Annata’s head. Maybe this guy could be useful after all. ‘Wait,’ said Annata, ‘what do you do with the pictures?’ ‘What do I do? Well…’ Lee lagged for a second to consider what Annata wanted, ‘I put them on my blog and social media, also the club newsletter.’ ‘Do you have many followers?’ ‘Over 30,000 now, not as many as some You-‘ ‘That’s great,’ Annata smiled, another thunder stroke on the river, making another deafening crackle, ‘Lee, I think we can help each other out.’ * * * Raindrops as large as green peas violently and endlessly crashed onto the glass pane. The whole room was flooded with the constant wind noise with occasional squeaking, as if the old and fragile roof was about to take-off at any second. However, for some reason, Ariel rather enjoyed watching a heavy storm like this from inside, especially when it was unusual to see a storm this bad in winter. It’s more interesting than a plain sunny day isn’t it? The rowing club people didn’t seem to agree. They were all sitting on the bench outside the meeting room, frowning at the grey sky and the rumbling waters. The last boat came back hurriedly after the thunderstorm warning was announced two hours ago apparently. ‘Do you think you can go back out there today?’ asked Horace. He just barely arrived with Ariel before the rain came pouring down. ‘No chance, it was really rough today. We almost had to be towed back by our coach because the waves were too big.’ Alya answered. ‘The others are probably stuck at school,’ Ariel glanced at the clock, ‘but not sure if they were held up by the weather or history lesson.’ ‘Who do they have for the history lesson?’ ‘Miss Swanson.’ ‘Oh…’ Alya raised her eyebrows a little, and then sat down with the boys. Earlier today, they agreed to study at the rowing clubhouse meeting room until dinner time for the test. Despite how the school encourages everyone to do their club activities, failing the test too badly could force you to repeat the school year or even kicked out. This was no time to relax. Whilst they were waiting for the others to turn up, the conversation naturally changed to the petition. ‘So we really aren’t allowed to do more petition at school until the tests are finished?’ asked Alya. Horace nodded. ‘Mrs Kim made it very clear in the morning school assembly that no activities except studying or First Tier sports team practices are allowed in December.’ ‘And we’d get in trouble if they see us in the school or in the town.’ Ariel added. ‘Shame…’ Alya flicked through the English textbook quickly. ‘How do you have time to study? I don’t get Geography at all.’ ‘It helps when you do outside a little more Ariel. Sometimes we rowing club go hiking as well. Geography is usually the seven or eight features.’ Horace was unconvinced. ‘Are you sure you have studied at all Alya? Geography is a lot more than that…’ Alya shrugged. ‘It’s fine, I will get the hang of it. How’s your studying coming along, Ariel?’ Ariel wasn’t listening though. He was devoting all of his attention to his computer again, only this time, rather than reading the online notes, he was looking up the news on Lanker Airlines. Lanker Airlines is opening a new office at the Pierra Docks… I see… Ariel read the news carefully. …the company’s managing director, Vitus Lanker, will be at the docks today to host the opening ceremony of the new branch. The new office, which will facilitate the helicopter flights to… ‘Ariel? Hello?’ said Alya, waving her hand between the screen and Ariel’s face to catch his attention. ‘Oh hello. Sorry what were you saying?’ ‘We were asking which subject you feel the least confident. Horace thinks Geography is the worst, and I’ll probably fail in Maths.’ ‘Uhh… let’s see. I think English Literature’s the hardest,’ Ariel slapped on his English textbook, ‘I mean, how do you tell what’s the writer thinking? I’m not a mind reader!’ As they were chuckling and continued half-heartedly studying their notes, the rain storm had finally calmed down slightly. The heavy down-pour had now become light drizzle. They decided to go downstairs to get some fresh air. There must be a leak in that old meeting room, the air smelt moister by the minute. Although it was just half-past six, the sky was already pitch black. Ariel wondered if the winter solstice had already past. The storm just now had made it even colder, it should already be snowing by now. The road along the waterfront was quiet and empty, almost enough to make Ariel felt uncomfortable, but hundreds of small streams rushing from the slope behind them towards the river reminded Ariel of the bad weather today. ‘Hey, by the way, are you still on that weather app for the National Hackathon?’ asked Horace suddenly. ‘Yes, I am. It was mostly done now, just need some finishing touches like making it look more professional. I couldn’t have done it without Pavel after Mrs Kim shuts down the school network for no reason.’ ‘So could you tell if when the rain will stop?’ Good point, thought Ariel, I hadn’t tested it in a while now. He ran back upstairs via the balcony stairs. The steel steps were as slippery as butter. When he checked the app, which made the forecast for this area, nothing but confusion filled his mind. He’d tested this app for countless times, and the forecast was accurate to the minute. However, the app didn’t predict this storm at all. It kept displaying sunny no matter how many times Ariel restarted it. That’s odd… very strange… is there a bug somewhere? Just when Ariel was about to walk back downstairs to the boat storage area, the rain had completely finally stopped. It goes as quickly as it comes. After Ariel reported his lack of findings to Alya and Horace, a pair of car headlights lit up the river barrier. A car had just driven down from the slope behind the boathouse. Normally, they wouldn’t had looked another eye, but because it was so quiet and empty, its rumbling engine caught all their attention. And it was a luxurious black Mercedes saloon car, a somewhat unusual sight at this small seaside town. ‘Mrs Kim is surely hardworking! Look how late she works,’ commented one of the rowers cleaning the boats. ‘That’s Mrs Kim’s car? I didn’t know she’s so rich!’ said Alya surprisedly. ‘Well, she did work in the city for many years. I guess she can’t get used to our slacking and old cheap cars.’ The black car stopped at the stop sign for a moment, but it didn’t turn right to the boathouse, instead, it made a sudden left turn into the darkness. ‘Where’s she going?’ asked the rower. ‘I don’t know. I thought she might come say hello to us.’ Alya said disappointedly. ‘What’s there anyway? That way is going out of Pierra. Barely anyone lives in that direction, there’s nothing except –‘ ‘-except the Pierra Docks!’ Ariel interrupted, remembering the news article that he read earlier. He immediately turned to Alya and the rower. ‘Is there a bicycle I can borrow? I need one now.’ * * * Chase found it surprising that Lee the photographer was so quick to comply with Annata’s deal, and wondered if he’d actually thought it through, or agreed to it because he was just keen to leave. Either way, maybe Lee would be helpful to their effort. The deal was really simple: since no one had heard of Lee’s Documentary Photography Club at school, but he had loads of public followers online, Annata would also promote the Documentary Photography Club by encouraging the students to go online and see the campaign with his photos when rallying, and Lee would report on their petition to the world with what Annata allowed to upload. There’s no such thing as bad publicity. By the time they finished with Lee, the rain had already stopped, so they hurried to the boathouse for what little time they had left for studying. They were already more than an hour late already. When they were walking downslope, a luxurious black saloon car glided past them, which spooked Lu a little, who didn’t come down to the waterfront too often. When they reached the boathouse and expected to apologise for being late, they were surprised once again when someone sped past them on a bicycle. ‘Wait Ariel!’ Alya shouted, looking as confused as they were. ‘Where’s he going?’ asked Chase. ‘I don’t know. He’s going after Mrs Kim’s car.’ Chase paused for a moment to make sure he’d heard everything correctly. We came to a study session, and now Ariel is chasing after the school principal? ‘I know he’s bad at English, but I didn’t know he’s so desperate to follow the school principal home for answers.’ ‘No I don’t think he was. He looked as if he just found a nuclear bomb and flew off with my bicycle.’ ‘I am going after him,’ said Alya suddenly. Just when the others were about to stop her, she’d already had her helmet on and dashed off from the boathouse, leaving a trail of wet tyre mark. * * * It took all of Ariel’s strength to catch up with the car’s rear lights. Ariel endlessly spun the pedals, and caught all the oxygen that he could. He started to regret treating the PE lessons as waste of time. The quiet road soon faded into a twisty mountain road. Although it still went along the river, the old and neat boathouses soon disappeared and replaced with dense woodland. The faint taillight soon disappeared on an uphill. Dammit. I can’t lose her. Finally making it to the top, Ariel stopped to catch his breath. As Ariel leaned on the handlebar, he saw a side of Pierra that he’d never seen before. The Pierra Docks was much busier and larger than Ariel thought. Countless bright white floodlights lit up the whole area like it was still noon. Colourful containers stacked up to the height of small tower blocks, and despite being 10pm, lorries and cranes tirelessly moved around and their beeping sounds echoed in the mountain. Mrs Kim’s car was easily visible in the light, which just passed the security gate and went to the docks. What on earth is she doing in the docks at this time? ‘Hey,’ said a familiar voice from the back. It was Alya. ‘Is that Mrs Kim’s car? What’s she doing there?’ ‘That’s why I cycled all the way here.’ ‘Come on, let’s get closer!’ Alya pedalled through the downhill without hesitation. Ariel was surprised, but decided not to wait. Just before the entrance to the docks, they found a little track that went through the woods that could take them near the fences. Ariel felt like being in the shooting game that he’d played two days ago. Slugging through the mud and climbing over a few fallen trees, Alya caught sight of Mrs Kim’s black saloon car. It was parked next the fence and just outside an office building. The words Lanker Airlines Pierra Helicopter Services were proudly displayed on it. They sat away from the fences and observed in the dark. Ariel shivered lightly, not because he was scared to get in trouble, but realising his instincts were correct. Mrs Kim was here to meet Mr Lanker. ‘What now?’ asked Alya. ‘Look,’ Ariel pointed at one of the windows, ‘Mrs Kim and Vito’s dad are meeting in their now.’ Ariel had seen enough of Mr Lanker’s photos appearing on the news and press releases in the last couple of months to remember what he looked like, but today was the first time seeing him in person. He looked angry, waving an arm while he was saying something to Mrs Kim, but Mrs Kim didn’t look intimated at all. She stood firmly, taking it all in. ‘How do you know Mrs Kim was meeting Vito’s dad?’ asked Alya. ‘I happened to read Mr Lanker is opening a new helicopter port today, and saw Mrs Kim driving to this direction, so I just… just assumed put two to two together.’ ‘I see…’ Alya looked impressed, ‘so I think this means Vito’s dad has something else to do with Mrs Kim? Not just as the PTA?’ ‘I guess. Look, they are coming out!’ Mrs Kim was about the leave the office, but Mr Lanker tried to convince her to stay. It didn’t work. Mrs Kim disappeared from view through the window and came out through the front door thirty seconds later. ‘Wait!’ Mr Lanker caught up, standing next to the door. ‘Fine. Fine. You win. I will keep playing your game,’ said Mr Lanker impatiently, ‘why do you have to expel the boy though? Why not say… dispose him only?’ Alya nearly screamed out loud but she covered her mouth in time. Ariel frantically tried to find his camera to record this, but it wasn’t easy in the dark. ‘That’s not your concern.’ said Mrs Kim firmly, ‘you only need to continue being a concerned parent and a responsible PTA leader, and keep on funding the school, of course. The boy is not relevant to what you do.’ ‘Of course it does,’ Mr Lanker got angry again, ‘everyone now thinks I am the reason that an innocent student’s life got destroyed over nothing. I put my reputation on the line here, madam.’ Ariel struggled to hold the camera steady whilst hearing all this. ‘That’s not part of your concern, Mr Lanker, keep on doing your PTA leader’s duties. Communications, meetings, being a concerned parent,’ said Mrs Kim calmly, ‘and I will make sure that you will get to run your business.’ ‘Well, let’s hope so,’ said Mr Lanker, ‘my son told me that the kids started some sort of petition?’ ‘Have they?’ asked Mrs Kim,’ well, look how far they’d go to protect their friend. Maybe you could learn a few things from them?’ ‘Excuse me?’ Mrs Kim got back in her car without responding. She swiftly reversed out and disappeared behind a lorry, leaving Mr Lanker with his hands in his pockets, still looking annoyed. Ariel stopped the recording, and carefully put it in his backpack. Alya was still covering her face, looked a little shocked. ‘Ariel… I think, I always think your theory is nothing more than just imagination, but now… I don’t know. Mrs Kim is really not the person she seems to be.’ Ariel shrugged, normally he’d proudly shout “I told you so”, but he was too startled by the conversation. He held his breath, and sent the video to the others."

      "chapterTitle": "Chapter 9 – Hackathon",
      "text": "Most of the class stared at the second hand of the classroom clock, whilst a few were frantically scribbling, desperately attempting to score as many points as possible. The teacher belonged to the former group, quietly counting down, ‘five… four… three… two… one…’ ‘…zero.’ A few students finished off the countdown when the time was exactly eleven am. ‘You must stop writing now,’ ordered the teacher, ‘make sure your name, class number, and the date are on the answer sheet. And no talking!’ The teacher went round to collect the answer sheet. Ariel always enjoyed this moment, a mix of relief of the test being over, and a disheartening grief of realising that they got the last answer wrong. The contrast was comical. Just get over it will you? The announcement of the test is over was like a dynamite blowing up a dam. The whole class erupted into overwhelming joy and cheers, even those who were sighing just earlier. In merely seconds, plans were discussed for catching a movie or going to someone’s house. However, things were less relaxed for Ariel. His mind had already shifted to the National Hackathon that was due to start in four hours in the capital city of Melian, and the next train leaves in twenty minutes. He sprinted out from the classroom and skipped half a flight of stairs by leaping down, surprising every person on the staircase. Pavel’s test had already finished this morning and they are supposed to meet at the Rowing Club boathouse to catch a train together. Ariel was thinking up excuses for not helping the restart of the petition. Pavel, as reliable as always, was already at the boathouse and talking to Annata and Alya, who also had their tests finished early today. ‘Great, Pavel, you are already here,’ said Ariel with relief, ‘and have you got your train tickets? Sleeping bag? Entry permit?’ ‘Sleeping bag? How long are you going be there for?’ asked Annata with disbelief. ‘It’s going to last 24 hours. They are going to give us challenges based on what we submitted, and we don’t know what those are yet.’ ‘I see… That sounds really tough. Go on! You’ve got this guys!’ Annata gave a rare cheer, which surprised Ariel a little, and she didn’t even complain about him slacking off from the petition. Maybe she has given up on me? Just when they were about to leave, someone ran towards them, holding something silver with the size of his palm. ‘Are you Ariel Wilora? From class 2B?’ asked the person, who was now standing in their way. ‘Umm… yes I am.’ ‘Did you and your father fix our boat a few months back? You know? The White Maiden?’ he pointed at a small white boat in the shed. Oh, the one we delivered just before the Activities Fair! Ariel nodded. ‘Ah great! We’ve been meaning to return this to you for, like, ever,’ said the guy happily, handing over the object to Ariel, ‘it was stuck under a panel at the front of the boat. It wasn’t ours and we know you are a computer genius, so we reckoned this belongs to you. Ariel was completely confused. I never go near dad’s work. It was an ordinary portable hard disk, there was nothing special about it, except a few scratches and no brand name. More importantly, Ariel was absolutely certain this wasn’t his. However, eager not to be, Ariel decided to thank him and put it in his bag. That was when his noticed it had a few words stencilled on it: Viktor Patrov. * * * The rhythm of the train clinking on the rails suddenly became a lot louder when they entered the tunnel, wiping out the view of Zentrum Union in the distant with a pitch black wall. Ariel was trying to mentally prepare for the Hackathon, but could not stop thinking what he and Alya saw in the Pierra Docks a few weeks ago, the secret meeting between Mrs Kim and Mr Lanker. I knew they were scheming something together. What bothered him was, they didn’t seem to be… on good terms. Mr Lanker looked furious, and Mrs Kim seemed to quite calm. This made no sense at all. And why is our principal meeting the Head of PTA at night in an industrial area? Was it something to do with Horace and the Debating Club? The train was making a turn in the tunnel. The deafening squeaking noise interrupted Ariel. Pavel was sitting on the opposite seat, focusing on his novel. ‘Pavel… can I ask you something?’ seeing Pavel like this raised Ariel’s curiosity. ‘Yeah? Sure?’ ‘Uhh…’ Ariel suddenly realised he had been being helped by Pavel for nearly five months now, but knew almost nothing about him. ‘Uhh… why are you helping me?’ Ariel asked the first thing sprang to mind. Pavel looked confused. ‘I mean, you could have enter a national competition yourself, and will probably win many awards just by yourself,’ continued Ariel, ‘and you could’ve joined a senior’s team. They’d probably beg you to join seeing how good you are. So, why help me?’ Pavel put down his book and thought for a second. ‘Well, you are the one introduced me to the Computing Club, weren’t you? And you needed help, so I helped.’ Ariel was left a little speechless. ‘Okay, I appreciate that… umm,’ Ariel started to worry to this would turn into a long train ride, making any school trip fun is the leader’s responsibility. ‘Next question, where are you from?’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘I mean…’ Ariel sensed he might hit a minefield, ‘are you… local? Did you move from the Melian City?’ ‘No, I didn’t, but I wasn’t originally from Pierra either,’ said Pavel quietly, almost whispering, ‘I was born in Zentrum Union.’ * * * The train finally emerged from the other side of the tunnel. The short and scatter houses, view of the vast and calm river were replaced with densely packed houses and apartment buildings, with a few highways running several storeys above them in the form of bridges, leading to the city centre. Several minutes later, the train was already travelling on a viaduct, penetrating high-rise office towers and shopping centres like in a mountain valley, about to arrive at the Melian City terminal station. However, Ariel didn’t even notice the city view. Learning Pavel was from Zentrum Union was the best thing that happened today, surpassing the finishing of the test. He’d always wondered what was going on in the far end of his bedroom view. Every kid in Pierra grew up hearing stories of Zentrum Union, but rarely got to talk to someone from there or even seeing one. And now, here was one, sitting opposite of him, flicking through a book. He relentlessly asked questions on what the country was like, were people poor there, were the public generally happy, why didn’t they move to Pyon, how different the laws were. The originally chit-chat had quickly turned into an interrogation, and Pavel just answered with minimal words, but he didn’t seem to be bothered. The discovery kept Ariel on high spirit when they arrived at the competition venue. It was a large indoor stadium that was redecorated. Fences used for partitioning table tennis tables were now used to separate one area from another. Apparently each school took one area, and given one table and two chairs only. They had been put at a table near the centre. ‘Right, here we go,’ said Ariel excitedly, ‘are you ready Pavel?’ It was 10:30 pm, five hours after the timer started, but they were feeling like they’d been awake for a week. Most of the teams looked in the hall looked like they just came back from a warzone as well. The judges came by earlier, who were apparently quite impressed by Ariel’s weather app and said Ariel had a bright future in the industry, more importantly, they scored much higher than the other teams as a result. However, perhaps they said that much potential in Ariel and Pavel, the improvised challenge they gave out was hard. They were told to make a function that uses your smartphone camera to do a weather forecast. Ariel wasn’t even sure that’s possible, not to mention for a 14-year old boy leading a 12-year old Grade 1 kid. Pavel had just left for the vending machine to buy some drinks, without his assistant, Ariel took a break by observing how others were doing. He could have sworn he could smell his brain overheating like an old car. ‘Hey! No peeking!’ an older looking boy from the team next to them jumped up and spread his arms like a goalkeeper. Ariel was impressed by his due-diligence despite everyone was obviously tired. ‘Calm down, I wasn’t peeking,’ explained Ariel, ‘we are working on different things anyway, aren’t we? How can I cheat?’ ‘Well, no peeking anyway.’ He sat back down. Just when Pavel returned with two cans of Aquamug grape lemon soda. ‘I… I think we could use some sugar kick.’ Pavel explained his choice of the strange flavour, but it tasted surprisingly good and refreshing. Ariel glanced at the blinking cursor line on his screen, wasn’t ready to get back to work yet. Maybe the tests have really drained all of my energy. ‘Hey, Pavel. You said you and your family moved here a few years ago? Do you have any brothers or sisters?’ ‘No, I was the only child. Just my mum, my dad and me.’ Ariel thought of his little brother, he wondered what would growing up without an annoying sibling that he had to constantly look after and “be a role model” be like. ‘Moving here must have been really difficult. It was just the three of you as well. How often you go home to visit your relatives?’ ‘Yes, it wasn’t easy, my mum and dad had to look after me and I needed to look after them too. We… we nearly lost mum several years ago, because dad lost his job at the market and we’d to keep rationing our food. She got sick and taken to the hospital.’ Pavel told his story slowly and quietly, barely audible in the end. ‘That’s why we needed to look out for each other, work hard for each other, because we’d lose them if we don’t.’ Pavel added with a long sigh, as if the conclusion was finally unearthed after being buried for years. For some reason, Pavel’s last remark stung Ariel a little in the back of his head. The images of his friends, Annata, Chase, Horace, Lu and Alya all have been standing in the cold and rallying people to help. When Lu was confronted by Vito, Horace and Alya stepped in; when Chase was too tired to carry on at the park, Annata stepped up. What have you been doing? Ariel asked himself, remembering no one called him on the petition even after the tests had finished. Doing this Hackathon for your club and school? Chasing after a conspiracy theory? Ariel wanted to call Horace to ask how was the petition along today, but realised his mobile phone was locked away when the competition started. ‘Are you making any progress?’ asked Ariel. ‘No, not really. I have a problem with the data set and …’ ‘Do you think you can do it by morning?’ ‘What? Uhh… umm…’ ‘Pavel, I am not trying to shout at you,’ Ariel reassured him, ‘I was stuck in my part as well, and I think we need to go back tomorrow and help the others, you know, with the petition.’ ‘What? What about the Hackathon?’ Pavel exclaimed. ‘I was just thinking what you said about looking after each other. We all agreed to help Horace and the Debating Club. Horace, Alya and Lu ran around and got the signature from almost every student in the school. Chase and Annata stood at the town centre for hours every day, even after school, to rally the passer-by. I should be actually helping as well, rather than coding day and night, and chasing after a conspiracy of Mrs Kim and Mr Lanker. This is just… too… selfish of me.’ ‘But, wait,’ Pavel was struggling to keep up, ‘what about the effort you’ve put in? You spent months on this!’ ‘More than one year,’ Ariel corrected him, ‘but screw the trophy and the return to school with glory. I need to help Horace. We are running out of time.’ ‘Yeah… but, it’s 1 a.m. now.’ Pavel pointed at the massive wall clock, ‘How are we getting back now? There’s no train back to Pierra.’ ‘Ah, well.’ Ariel felt like he’d just woken up the second time when he realised the scattered keyboard noise and chattering in the hall had been replaced by yawns and snoring. ‘Let’s go in the morning. I will hand in whatever we have done so far and tell them we need to leave. I doubt we’d work out anything tomorrow either.’ Pavel looked a little frustrated but eventually accepted. Soon, Pavel was overcome by the sleep-deprivation. After staring at the computer screen for another twenty minutes, but the endless error messages and the blinking cursor line slowly drove Ariel into his dreams. * * * Ariel wasn’t sure what woke him. It was either his back pain from the uncomfortable sleeping position, or the drool that he left overnight on the desk. He took a few seconds to remember that he wasn’t sleeping in his bedroom. The wall clock said it had just past 8 a.m. and Pavel was still sleeping. Ariel wondered how he could sleep like a baby on the hardwood floor, sleeping bag helped very little. He decided to let him sleep a little longer and passed the time by wandering in the venue. Least I could do after deciding to abandon this competition on behalf of both of us. Just behind the judges’ stand, which housed a few sleeping volunteers presumably from a university, was the main entrance. Ariel remembered the whole hall was part of the larger exhibition centre. Driven by curiosity, Ariel wandered into the only exhibition hall that was opened this early. Much to his delight, it wasn’t some kind of kitchenware trade show, but a full-fledge tech show. Robots, drones, some strange hi-tech cameras, and other cool stuff were simply sitting there. And the hall was as empty as the school library after the exam finished. The sleepiness dispersed instantly and Ariel couldn’t stop scanning the interesting products the companies and the universities were showing. He wished he’d had all day just examining everything in this room like being in a museum. Just when he was about to check out a drone that looked like a surfboard, he heard someone called him from behind, but it wasn’t Pavel, or in fact, anyone he recognised. ‘Hi! You are Ariel Wilora, correct?’ a man with thin glasses and well-combed hair in a perfectly-ironed suit approached Ariel. Instinctively, Ariel took a step back. ‘Who are you?’ ‘Oh sorry, my name is Anthony Carpenter,’ said the man as he flicked his pass on his left chest, ‘I am working for a company called Lanker Corporations, and we are an exhibitor here. Have you heard of us?’ The company name sent a shockwave through Ariel. Crap! It’s Vito’s dad’s company! Did they find out Alya and I were watching Mrs Kim and Mr Lanker’s meeting? Ariel nodded cautiously. ‘Do you mind coming to our stand? We have something to show you.’ Anthony showed Ariel a large stand at the far end with a smile. Ariel felt like his liked his guy even less. A white circular cylinder awaited both of them. It was about half as tall as Ariel and it had a barrel sticking out from its side, and a camera mounted on the top. ‘Is this some sort of gun?’ ‘No, no, no. God no, we are not showing a middle school student weapons,’ Anthony laughed, ‘we noticed your Hackathon submission. Very interesting invention indeed, your weather forecast app is precise to the minutes at where you stand.’ ‘Uhh… thanks?’ ‘We think you might be interested in this. This is a machine that changes weather,’ he said proudly, ‘to be precise. It can make fog or even rain appears out of nowhere.’ Ariel remained unconvinced at the shiny white machine that looked like a robot from a 1990s Sci-Fi movie, but as Anthony passionately explained how the barrel emits negatively-charged ions particles and how they excite the water droplets in the air, Ariel thought this might work after all. ‘What do you use it for?’ Ariel asked. ‘Many things, young man. Making rain where there hasn’t rained for weeks, helping farmers to grow the crops in dry season… you know the possibilities are endless.’ ‘I see…’ Ariel noticed there was a photo on banner behind him, showing the machine attached to a helicopter. ‘Did you test this on a helicopter as well?’ ‘Ah yes,’ the man looked at the direction of Ariel’s finger, ‘we lent out a few to the Pyon Border Patrol. I think they used it on boats as well and tested those on River Pearson, you know, near where your school is. I heard that they found those really effective and managed to create some heavy rains a few weeks ago.’ ‘Oh, there you are!’ Pavel’s voice suddenly raised from behind, closely followed by the sound of some unsteady running footsteps. ‘I’ve been looking for you.’ ‘Oh hey, good morning Pavel. Sorry I thought you were still sleeping.’ ‘The other team’s chattering woke me up, something about you disappeared off to cheat.’ Pavel explained, ‘anyway, I’ve already told them we need to leave early, and gave them what we made so far.’ ‘Thanks Pavel, umm,’ Ariel turned back to Anthony, ‘sorry we need to head back now. Nice to meet you.’ ‘You too, Ariel, and… Pavel?’ Anthony took out a few business cards from his jacket, ‘we are always looking for enthusiastic and talented young people to join us. I can introduce you to a summer internship too.’ It was a surprising offer for Ariel, but he was keen to get on the next train back home. My friends need me. So he simply thanked him and rushed to the train station with Pavel. As the view of dense and compact buildings slowly dissolved to vast fields and scattered houses, the train slowly clinkered a handful of passengers to the small seaside town of Pierra. Ariel was still wondering how did that man find him, but it couldn’t be a coincidence that he works for Lanker and also develops some weather technology. But why does it matter? I need to help others to keep Horace and his club! Ariel slapped on his face lightly to remind himself. ‘Are you okay?’ asked Pavel concernedly, ‘we are suddenly going back and you looked like you’ve seen ghost. What’s the matter?’ ‘Nothing, I am fine.’ Ariel said calmly, ‘it’s just that I found out why our weather forecast app suddenly didn’t predict the storm a few times before the exam.’ * * * ‘It’s alright. Maybe they are tired too.’ Ariel’s mum carefully put a cup of hot green tea on the coffee table, and said with a smile. ‘I’m sure they felt like having a day off after the tests only. They wouldn’t turn you away because you left for a day.’ ‘Maybe, I am not so sure because I didn’t help them in too long,’ Ariel mourned, laying down on the sofa and staring at the ceiling emptily, ‘even after I decided to rush back this morning. I called Horace, he didn’t answer. Then I called Chase, who was in the middle of a lunch delivery on his bicycle. Then I called Annata, and she said I’d better off “playing detective with the Grade 1 kid”. And I didn’t even bother calling Lu and Alya at that point.’ ‘So your friends have abandoned you? I knew this day would come.’ Ariel’s little brother Kyle lifted his head from his pot of mango ice cream. ‘Shut up.’ ‘Hey, don’t be rude to your brother,’ ordered mum, ‘give them a few days. You will see them next week, right?’ ‘Yeah, at Moonbucks Café in the shopping centre.’ Apparently the girls didn’t fancy Chase’s noodle bar or the mouldiness of the boathouse too much. ‘Exactly! Look, it’s only for a day. It’s just past noon yet, why don’t you think of something else to do? I need to leave for work now.’ Mum then left Ariel with his tea and Kyle with his ice cream. Ariel realised how he’d nothing to occupy himself when the Hackathon is done and no one needed him for the petition. After burying his head in the project for months, he was struggling how he’d passed the time before. ‘Hey big bro, what’s that?’ Kyle came picked up the silver hard disk on the coffee table. Oh that’s right! The guy at the rowing club gave this to me yesterday morning! ‘You didn’t drop anything in dad’s workshop right?’ ‘No. Why would I go in there? Dad doesn’t like us poking around in the workshop. He says it’s dangerous.’ Well. It was no surprise. Dad didn’t use any computer gadgets and he could barely send an email, so it most likely didn’t belong to him. The guy who handed this over seemed quite certain that it wasn’t there before they sent the damaged boat to dad for repair. So, how on earth did it end up in the White Maiden ? Ariel examined the disk closer. It definitely wasn’t brand new. In fact, there was a few scratches and even a small dent in the back. It smelt a little damp as well. Ariel wondered if this was already broken. As he found before, there was no brand name or markings on it, except the name Viktor Patrov engraved on it. ‘I’ve never heard of this brand before.’ Kyle commented. ‘I think it the person this belongs to.’ ‘Is it someone from your school? Can we give it back?’ ‘I don’t think so. The name is too… too Zentrum Union, and we don’t have a lot of them from our school.’ Except Pavel. ‘Why don’t you plug it in and see what’s inside?’ ‘What? Into my computer?’ Ariel asked in surprise, ‘what if it has virus in it? It will destroy my computer more than that time you dropped your ice cream on it.’ ‘I wiped it off immediately that time,’ defended Kyle, ‘would you stop bring it up again and again? My god…’ Bearing in mind of the risk of ruining the computer, Ariel remembered there was an old one that no one have been using in the upstairs storage room. After a lot of struggle with moving dusty photo albums, old clothes and a guitar set that Kyle used to play, the old laptop computer was finally free and booted to life. Feeling like unlocking a treasure chest with a long-lost key, Ariel inserted the cable into the laptop. It buzzed suddenly for a fraction of a second, which prompted both of them to jumped back slightly, thinking it might explode. Eventually, the hard disk seemed to be working as well. Half a dozen folders appeared before them. Some of them are written in Zentrumian. So this thing is actually from Zentrum Union! Ariel thought excitedly, this could reveal all of their secrets! Ariel clicked on one of them, but an error message appeared: Sorry. This file may be corrupted. He then tried another one, it was the same. Then the next one, the same. Their hype from one minute ago immediately took a nosedive. ‘So it was no good after all.’ Kyle sighed as he laid his head sideway on the coffee table. Ariel clicked on the last folder, not expecting much at this point, but was greeted with one file in it. Instantly, he cheered in excitement. The only file in it was a slideshow in Zentrumian. Ariel couldn’t read most of it, but judging by the figures and graphics. It was related to the northwest region of Pyon and how to carry out some sort of plan and processes. Pierra was one of the topics too. Was this meant to be a geography school project? ‘Look here bro,’ Kyle pointed the bottom corner of the slideshow, ‘it’s the Zentrum Union government logo.’ Ariel recognised the seal and the language from TV as well. Ariel scrolled to the next slide. Out of nowhere, Mr Lanker’s face appeared on it. How on earth…? His photo looked official, he was looking at the camera dead straight and with a dead serious face. It was probably taken some years ago as well, he looked younger than Ariel remembered from that night. He proceeded to scroll through a few more pages. This casual afternoon activity that was meant to pass time had ultimately turned into another day of investigation. The next few slides were all in Zentrumian. Then Mrs Kim’s photo appeared. ‘Isn’t she your temporary principal?’ asked Kyle, ‘Why’d she be on this random hard drive?’ Beats me, Ariel thought, and I doubt she’s even temporary anyone, she seemed so comfortable in her position and everyone kind of likes her. Strangely, Ariel felt relief when he saw both of their photos appearing back-to-back. This would be the final proof to Annata and the others that he wasn’t chasing after a story he’d made up. No, no, no, I need to stop thinking about that. Helping with Horace and the petition is what matters now. Ariel reminded himself again. He wasn’t sure if the Mr Lanker and Mrs Kim’s relationship are related to Horace being expelled after all. He’d decided to stop wasting time on that yesterday. However, in the next slide, six words that were not in Zentrumian made Ariel’s heart nearly stopped. Next to a photograph of their school, taken from inside the school at the basketball court, and another photograph of the Debating Club Conference at the town hall a few months ago, the six words read: Central Pierra Secondary School Debating Club."

      "chapterTitle": "Chapter 10 – Spring Holiday",
      "text": "The life in the city must be difficult, because mum had gone for nearly a week and only called home once. Kyle was worriedly asking what was going on, but mum just explained the work was way too busy for her and her undermanned team to handle. Apparently, ever since the Pyonian government signing the trading agreement with Zentrum Union four months ago, she’d been snowed under by accounting files and memos from the other side of the river. However for Ariel, this week felt strange and empty, because it was the first week of the three-week Spring holiday. Instead of searching for every person in town for a signature, the others being too busy with their own business meant that he was only searching for TV shows across eight different Pyonian channels. Finally, the day that they agreed to meet at the Moonbucks Café had arrived. Ariel sprung up from bed and got ready at lightning speed. He never thought he’d ever look forward to seeing his friends this badly, but compared to the stress and tiresome of socialising, he hated being kept out of loop far more. Just when Ariel finished gulping his butter toast, mum finally came back home. She looked like she’d just return from the Himalayas. ‘Oh good morning, Ariel, you are up early, did you get enough sleep?’ she asked concernedly, even though she looked obviously more tired. ‘Good morning mum! I am just about leaving to see the others.’ ‘Horace and the others? Poor boy. He doesn’t deserve getting expelled because a school club caused some nuisance.’ ‘He’s not getting expelled, we are going to make sure of that.’ Ariel said firmly. ‘Will you be staying long this time mum?’ ‘I need to go again on Monday I’m afraid. They even started to put some Zentrum people in our office, saying it was a “big step to international collaboration”, but they rarely talked and even asking them to go for lunch was a problem!’ ‘That sounds tough. Was it the language barrier?’ ‘I don’t know. I reckon we just need to get used to it, not every Zentrum person is like that though,’ mum continued whilst making herself a cup of green tea, ‘I used to get some files faxed over once a week from one particular person from Zentrum Union, along with some memo. I’ve never seen her, but she was always quick on her feet and always get back to me if something was missing. I wish everyone was like her.’ ‘Her? Have you talked to her?’ Ariel was surprised. ‘No I haven’t. She always sign her messages in such a nice elegant manner, it was impressive. Her name was Liliya Patrov. Sometimes, she included messages in the papers, but they were all broken and didn’t make sense. We used to joke that Liliya was trying to give us puzzles to pass the time. Sadly, one day the files were suddenly faxed over by someone else, maybe she resigned?’ Patrov? The same surname as the name on the hard disk, but it’s all too convenient isn’t it? Ariel thought to himself. ‘I don’t know… anyway, I’ve got to go now. Bye mum!’ * * * Chase was both excited and envious at how nice the refurbished shopping centre was. Before it shut its doors more than a year ago for refurbishment, this place was dark, gloomy, half of the shops were questionable restaurants, laundries, clothes stores, the other half were always empty, and barely anyone walks through this place. This was one of those places that wouldn’t affect your life if it’d disappeared suddenly, but you’d feel something wasn’t quite right. Today was Chase’s first time walking in after they opened the doors, and what a difference it was. Chase thought he was in one of those flagship shopping centres at the capital. Everywhere was bright and smart, and they even had a Japanese and Korean supermarket, and a Moonbucks Café opened. Chase thought he must convenience mum and dad to move the family noodle bar here. Annata, Lu, Alya and Horace were already there. Everyone had a cup of fancy coffees that Chase couldn’t pronounce in front of them. ‘Did you oversleep? You’re late.’ Annata complained impatiently whilst sipping her cup. ‘Hey! I rode here as soon as I can. It’s not fault that they transformed this place,’ defended Chase immediately, ‘there’s so much to see here!’ ‘Why are the boys always late? Horace is okay, but we’ve been waiting fifteen minutes for you, and where’s Ariel?’ ‘I don’t know. I’ve told him we are meeting up here at 9 a.m. already. Maybe he doesn’t want to listen to your irritating voice blabbing like a broken radio?’ Chase suggested with a chuckle. ‘I don’t know. Or maybe he doesn’t want to see your ugly face crumbled up like crushed plastic bag?’ Annata fought back, too with a sneaky chuckle. That was your comeback? ‘Nonsense. This place has been made even more charming by my handsome look.’ Chase responded confidently. Lu and Alya slowly put down their coffees, looking about to puke. ‘Remind me to buy you a mirror for your birthday, Chase,’ Ariel said suddenly from behind, who promptly took a seat next to Chase, ‘I think you need one.’ ‘Alright, alright! Now that we are all here, I’ve got something planned and wanted to tell you guys, but erm… I think Annata wanted to speak first?’ Horace interrupted. ‘Yeah. I wanted to share our progress on the petition earlier, but some of us are more punctual than others.’ Annata explained with a strong glare at Chase and Ariel. ‘The Student Council said normally we only need 2/3 of all students to make a petition counted as successful, which is 600, but Mrs Kim said we also needed 500 from the locals because… well, they are the ones started it all.’ ‘That woman’s an evil.’ Ariel said angrily. ‘She’s got the school’s reputation to protect, I don’t think she’s unreasonable. Anyway, we have had…’ Annata looked excited and did a little drumroll with her fingers, ‘623 student signatures!’ Alya and Lu cheered joyfully. Chase gave Horace a firm solid pat in the back as congratulation. ‘That’s incredible work! How’d you managed to do that?’ ‘Well, Horace is liked by a lot of people, and no one particularly refused to sign it except the Drama Club. Many people didn’t really care enough to sign their names though, they just think it wasn’t their business.’ ‘What about the public ones?’ ‘We have…only 300 so far. Not good enough despite us standing in the streets and even got our friends from other schools and relatives signing.’ ‘What’s the problem?’ Chase found it amazing that they were half way already. All the effort spent standing at the park and near the fountain did not go into waste. ‘What’s the problem? It’s already March but we just made 60%. We need to work harder for this, and we need more help.’ Annata proclaimed worriedly. I never knew Annata is glass-half-empty kind of person, Chase thought, taking a sip from the hot chocolate that just arrived. Just when Chase was about to offer some reassurance, Horace suddenly stood up. The clatter of his wooden chair caught everyone’s attention. He seemed calm, with his usual charismatic smile, but out of nowhere, he took the deepest bow that Chase had ever seen. He thought Horace was about to smash his head on the table. ‘Horace! What… what are you doing?’ Lu said hurriedly. ‘I honestly don’t know how to thank you guys for everything you’ve done. I owe you everything.’ Horace said slowly. Unlikely last time, he didn’t break down into tears, and it’d been a while since it felt Horace was genuinely relieved and happy. There’s light at the end of the tunnel. After Lu had eventually talked him to sit down, Annata and Alya admitted they actually quite enjoyed the rallying. ‘It was so much better than just going to school clubs every day and miss seeing your friends in order to win the next match,’ said Alya, ‘it’s nice to do something not for the sake of only yourself or the school for once.’ ‘Speaking of for the sake of ourselves…’ Ariel chipped in quietly, ‘I’d like to help with the petition, with… you know, getting the rest of the signatures.’ Annata didn’t look pleased. ‘You said the petition wouldn’t work, so you went on and did a “Sherlock Holmes” on Vito or Mrs Kim or whoever it was,’ she said bemusedly, folding her arms, ‘so why the change in attitude? You fed up with your little game?’ Ariel took a deep breathe, and then explained what he heard from Pavel and his family moving from Zentrum Union during the Hackathon. ‘I also saw Lanker made a weather-changing device, and how it made my app went wrong’ Ariel mumbled, ‘it somehow made me think… maybe I was just chasing a sham all this time. It could all be nothing and just smoke and mirrors. All I know is, I’ve been wasting time and not helping out the petition with the others, whilst Horace is on the brink of being kicked out, over something he shouldn’t be responsible for.’ ‘So?’ ‘So, I thought I was helping, but I actually hadn’t done anything. Anything solid, anyway, so I’ve made up my mind and help with the petition only.’ The group fell silent for a few moments, it felt like whoever spoke first would destroy their friendship. Chase restrained himself from busting out a joke. ‘Okay, fine,’ Annata sighed and gave in, ‘but don’t you off sneaking off somewhere suddenly when we are working, okay? We really need every person to help Horace now.’ I wonder if Moonbucks’ atmosphere put her in a good mood today? Chase glanced at Horace. He should be saying something about Ariel’s re-admittance to the group, but instead, he suddenly made an unexpected proposal. ‘I think we can take a break for a little longer. Everyone has been working so hard on helping the club and me,’ said Horace, ‘why don’t we take a camping trip to the mountains next week? We still have two weeks of spring holiday left and it’ll be fun!’ Chase nearly burst out laughing. So this is the real reason why Horace wanted to have an emergency meeting. * * * The definition of ‘lateness’ must have been misunderstood by Chase, he thought, after arriving five minutes early at the train station, but still getting shouted at by Annata because everyone had arrived even earlier. ‘I think this trip is going to help you,’ Chase explained his thoughts to Annata on the train, ‘your face is starting to deform after months of shouting and pouting. The TV show I watched said being in a rural mountain helps you relax.’ As expected, Annata seemed less able to relax. Mount White, the mountain that separated Pierra and the in-land capital of Melian City, looked intimidatingly tall when viewed from the train and shrouded in mist and fog. Despite this, it was actually a popular hiking and camping destination, even for foreigners. Over the years, Chase had served many hikers and tourists at the family noodle bar, who enjoyed their last restaurant meal before going in to the mountains. However, Chase’d never been up there. ‘This is a great idea Horace!’ Chase complimented when they were about the get off the train to change for the local buses, ‘this is an awesome adventure!’ ‘Yeah, I think we will have a great three days coming up.’ ‘Adventure? How old are you? Seven?’ Ariel mourned as they sat down at the rear of the bus, and strangely, Annata shook her head slightly in agreement. Lu proclaimed loudly, ‘It’s NOT about the age, Ariel! Being away from the city and town and submerged in the natural beauty, with nothing but the smell of fresh grass after the rain, the sound of the wind brushing the leaves, and the view of the starry Milky Way at night, all whilst having a campfire in the forest is what this is all about! It freshens your mind and makes you appreciate things that are less… artificial and materialistic!’ Everyone looked at Lu in awe. ‘I didn’t know you are that into camping, Lu.’ Alya said carefully. Lu looked a little embarrassed. ‘Umm, I’ve actually never tried camping before. My family, you know, always keeps an eye on me and we usually go to dinners or balls at my dad’s business partners’ or friends’ places. We… don’t really have a family trip like hiking or camping.’ ‘Well here’s your chance, Lu, we will have a great time!’ said Horace, pointing at the valley that just came into view. It was difficult to work out how long the bus had been climbing up. After endless turns and ups and downs, Chase was half-expecting to see heaven in the any second. Luckily, it was an open field that eventually came into view. Horace swiftly pressed the bell. The campsite was surrounded by some steep mountains with dense woods between them. However, River Pearson was clearly visible on one end, where most people pitched their tents and set up their tables. Despite being the holiday season, the place was quieter than Chase expected, which made him even more excited. ‘So when are we exploring the woods and the mountains?’ Chase asked excitedly. ‘Hold up. We need to pitch our tents first.’ Alya said as she unloaded her backpack and took out her tent. Horace brought another one for the boys. It didn’t take long for everyone to realise nobody was an experienced camper. Chase never expected to see Ariel getting hit by a tentpole when the elastic band pulled the thing back. Subsequently he volunteered to look for things to burn for the campfire. Lu was too immersed in the fancy camping equipment to set up the cooker properly. Alya was struggling to find which ring to fit into. On the other hand, Annata was calmly giving instructions on which hook connects to where. It seemed she’d done this at least once. It also took Chase and Horace a little while to figure out how to pitch the tent. Chase couldn’t help expressing his disappointment in Horace as he brought it. The group finished pitching the boys’ and girls’ tents and the cooker just when Ariel returned with two plastic bags of branches and conifer cones. It was already starting to get dark. ‘Let’s start preparing for dinner guys!’ Annata announced as she rolled up her sleeves. Chase learned that apparently chicken curry was everyone’s favourite when they were planning the trip. We need to add that to our noodle bar menu. Chase quickly took out the groceries, including the crisps and chocolate from the supermarket by the station. ‘I’ve managed to get some really fresh carrots, potatoes and corn from Mr Brown, our grocer that we buy vegetables from,’ Chase said proudly, ‘he left me some nice ones immediately when I told him we were going camping.’ ‘Thank your parents for us.’ Annata and the others giggled as she and Alya began chopping. The wind remained calm throughout the night, a rare sight in springtime Pyon indeed. As Chase gently fanned the campfire, he noticed it was already pitch black. So much for exploring the woods today, he thought. He scanned the rest of the area to see how everyone was doing. The girls were doing a great job making the curry pot, which was now boiling with the fresh cut-up vegetables and some diced chicken that Horace brought, gave out an irresistible scent. Ariel, who obviously lacked cooking experience, took up the simple job of making the rice, which was being boiled above another gas cooker. Chase wondered if he was paying attention as he hadn’t moved an inch at all. The camp fire slowly breathed into life. The crackling woods burned strongly above the conifer cones. He was impressed that Ariel, being a computer geek, knew something about starting a fire in nature. Lu and Alya quietly sat down by the campfire, looking mesmerised by the orange flames. ‘I think we can barbeque some marshmallow here for our desert.’ Chase proposed. ‘Really? We even brought marshmallow? Great!’ Lu was so excited that she nearly clapped. ‘You look like a different person since we got on the bus, Lu.’ Alya smiled. ‘I… I can’t tell you long I’ve wanted to go on a trip like this, with my friends. Like I said, we never go on a trip like this with my family.’ ‘Why not?’ Chase asked without hesitation, then Alya immediately stared back disapprovingly, but Lu didn’t seem to mind though. ‘My family runs a big company in Melian City. I used to live there, but then my father decided that I needed to be educated somewhere no only excellent at grades, but even more excellent at all sorts of extra-curricular activities. Art, calligraphy, debating, maths, all sorts of stuff. It made it looked… good in the family.’ Lu slowly explained, still looking at the fire. ‘That’s why you moved to Pierra? To go to our school?’ ‘Uh-huh. Saved the money and effort of hiring a private tutor as well. My father always believes in survival of the fittest, so he reckoned being in such a competitive school will… umm… makes me stronger in some way too, I guess,’ Lu continued, ‘so I joined the Debating Club. Watching how father convinced others in a business deal might have had an influence on me. However, frankly back in Grade 1, I was terrified because everyone seemed so confident in themselves and felt like, they’d do anything to win each other, even their friends.’ ‘I know what you mean,’ Alya said as she tried to get warmer by the fire, ‘there’re some guys like that in the Rowing Club as well, bunch of jerks.’ ‘Exactly, but no one seemed to bother. I nearly quitted the club, but was quite afraid that my father would be furious. That was when Horace came asked if I wanted to go practising with him. He showed me the ropes.’ ‘I see. I didn’t know that…’ ‘And I think after a while, I felt that… maybe you don’t need to make every person your enemy to win something. Maybe there’s room for kindness and helping each other out too.’ ‘I think your father meant something different when he said survival of the fittest,’ Chase decided to chip in after having an epiphany, ‘I think there’re more than one ways of surviving, maybe he was telling you to rely on your friends? Like how Horace helped you back in Grade 1?’ Lu felt silent into deep thought, but she shook her head eventually. ‘No I don’t think so, but I see your point,’ she said firmly, ‘I am going to prove that point to my father.’ ‘You will,’ Alya went over and hugged Lu tightly, ‘I feel like we should be toasting drinks now… but we are still underage.’ Horace handed out a few cans of melon sodas. Lu quietly accepted it and held it in her palms, deep in thought. Horace opened his can first and made a toast. ‘Thank you for everyone again for the petition, for trying to keep the club going, and at the same time, me going as well. Cheers!’ ‘Cheers!’ Chase wondered if all adults cure their depression by doing something similar, just with a can of alcohol instead of soft drink, but shouting cheers loudly was quite fun indeed. He popped open his can, looking forward to the dinner. * * * It never occurred to Chase, or in fact, anyone, that the rice can be cooked so horribly. The delicious curry and the warm bonfire in front of him were only consolations to this mess of a dinner, thanks to the rice that looked like they’d been through a nuclear reactor and felt like crumbling concrete. ‘Ariel, remind me not to come over to your place when your mum isn’t around to cook. I don’t want to die yet.’ ‘Hey, it’s not that bad, although I’d admit this is below average because there’s no rice cooker here.’ ‘Thank you for your effort, it’s… unique.’ Alya politely complimented while crunching the rice in her mouth. ‘Look, look, look,’ Ariel put down his plate, ‘I heard that in the US, they actually fry their rice and somehow made it so hard that it became a cuisine on its own.’ ‘Really?’ ‘Think so, I saw it on TV last week.’ The wind started to pick up and swept up a cloud of fallen leaves suddenly. Everyone moved closer to the bonfire. Chase felt the radiating heat on his face and chest, but it didn’t stop the evening gust sending a chill down his spine. Interestingly, the gusts didn’t seem to bother Alya and Annata, Chase wondered if the rigorous training in the rowing team had made them immune to catching a cold. Soon, everyone was so full that they could barely walk. Chase felt like a huge bag of curry lingering around the campsite. Packing up and cleaning were the tedious work that no one wanted to do, so naturally, all plates and spoons were dumped into a bucket of water through the night. Chase had always wanted to do that, but his parents insisted on keeping everything clean and tidy in the restaurant. ‘Hey, hey, what should we do now?’ Annata asked as she sat down by the dying bonfire. Horace also sat down after adding more timber. ‘Well, we can talk about the petition…’ Lu suggested. ‘No, no. Sorry Lu, I think we should take a break from that for moment. Let’s not forget we are here to have fun today!’ Horace said as he fanned the fire vigorously. ‘How about what we are doing tomorrow? Exploring the mountains?’ Chase suggested, seeing an opportunity to remind everyone that they didn’t get to go in to the mountains after spending hours cooking. ‘Aha, I’ve got a route planned already.’ Horace took out a map from his pocket. He laid it out on the picnic table, looking like an army general planning an attack. ‘So, we are here,’ Horace explained as he pointed a red ring on the map, ‘if we start here… then follow this path… make a right and cross the river… up the stairs here… we would get to this viewing spot.’ ‘What’s there to see?’ ‘Apparently you can see most the Zentrum Union, all the way to the bridge in the south, and also Melian City on the other side.’ ‘I wouldn’t mind seeing more of Zentrum Union at all!’ Ariel said excitedly. Lu’s eyes also lit up. ‘Hiking, crossing bridges and rivers? This is what an adventure is!’ ‘I don’t think it will be like finding lost treasures… but surely sounds a lot fun!’ Alya agreed. Surprised to see everyone in agreement for once, Horace slowly put away his map. And everyone quickly got in to their tents for the night. The next morning, mist was shrouding the entire campsite, Chase could not even see the mountains, but beams of weak sunlight were trying their best to break through it. Beautiful. Chase was half-expecting a horrible sleep, but in fact it was as good as his bed. The sleeping mat and sleeping bag were more comfortable that he thought. He noticed Horace and Ariel were already gone when he woke up and they were making breakfast. ‘Good morning!’ ‘Morning.’ ‘You guys are up early! Can’t wait to get started?’ ‘Well, we didn’t choose to be early...’ Ariel said slowly whilst scrambling the eggs, ‘do you know, umm, where did you put your head last night?’ ‘And arms?’ Horace added. What kind of question is that? Chase shook his head. ‘Well, they were not on your mat.’ Horace answered. Ariel jumped up and splashed some egg on Chase’s face. ‘You were sleeping between Horace and me. In like five minutes after we tucked in, you started snoring with the noise level of an orchestra. Then somehow you laid your head on my belly and…’ ‘…and stuck your legs on my chest,’ said Horace as he rubbed his chest in pain, ‘even though you were in your sleeping bag. I have no idea how you managed to move around so much in your sleep.’ ‘Eh?’ ‘Yeah, and we tried to wake you and pushed you back, but you always rotate by 90 degrees and used your friends as your pillow and footrest! By the time we’d done pushing ten times, it was already morning!’ An annoyed Ariel continued. ‘Really? Umm. Sorry chaps!’ Chase laughed embarrassedly, ‘the good news is, I slept very well!’ Luckily, Ariel turned his attention to the burning sausages instead of fighting Chase. Soon, the girls joined in as well. ‘Good morni… wait, what’s wrong?’ Alya took notice of the awkward atmosphere. ‘Nothing…’ Chase could feel Horace’s stare shooting his back like a pair of laser beams. ‘It’s freezing! I didn’t expect it to be this cold up here, even in March!’ Lu rubbed her hands rapidly and kept breathing into them. ‘Oh, right. My dad told me that the mountains are usually five degrees lower than Pierra, and the winds are blowing from the north in spring too.’ Horace explained, but Lu wasn’t interested in this fact, Alya put on a spare jacket on her. Everyone was pleasantly surprised when Ariel didn’t burn the breakfast, who thought frying sausages and eggs were way easier than cooking rice with gas stove. Nevertheless, everyone was fed and packed up within half an hour. Horace decided it was safe to leave the tents and the rest of the things at the campsite. Bringing just a backpack in this group of six, Chase felt like an explorer off to discover forgotten treasures in the woods. He noticed Lu was cheerfully humming a tune, and was glad that he probably wasn’t the only one picturing that. Most of the trees already had their leaves grown back after winter, creating a dense woodland, shielding everything under one giant green umbrella. However, every feature was as clear as day, the moist on the fallen tree, small streams rushing down between the rocks, and the gravel path that they were following slowly and steadily. It was very quiet, as if all animals and insects had disappeared from this world, but it didn’t feel creepy at all, in fact, Chase hadn’t felt this relaxed since the petition thing started. As the fresh air caressed his face gently with a smell of fresh leaves, he realised how stressed and worried he really had been this whole time, despite goofing around with the others for most of the days. It wasn’t until the first stone bridge came into view, someone finally voiced up. ‘Hey, Horace, how do you know so much about the mountains? Do you go camping a lot?’ Alya asked, making her way up the slippery stones. ‘My dad used to take the whole family camping quite often. We’d spend our days in some mountain or lakeside or beach almost every other weekend.’ Horace said as he followed Alya’s footsteps, ‘When my dad was still working as a Security Officer, he was stationed at a nearby hillside, so he knew the weather in the mountains like the back of his hand. He said he had nothing but the stars and owls by his side at night.’ ‘That sounds quite romantic!’ ‘But quite a lot of mosquitos in the summer.’ Lu grunted. ‘Ehh, no thanks.’ ‘Anyway, he taught me all these stuff. Pitching tents, hiking, navigation, dress properly here.’ ‘Why didn’t you join the Mountaineering Club? It’s odd that you are in the Debating Club only.’ Horace chuckled. ‘After spending half of your childhood in the nature, and keep doing that in secondary school? I think I am alright.’ Ariel joined in, even he was struggling to keep up. ‘But… but… I’ve never heard you went camping recently? How come?’ Horace stopped on the stone bridge, and looked a waterfall next the bridge splashing water everywhere. ‘After my dad was fired from his job, he stopped taking us. Instead he… well, he mostly came home drunk these days.’ Ariel looked embarrassed. ‘Umm. Sorry.’ ‘No, it’s okay. Don’t worry about it,’ Horace quickly recovered to his usual self, ‘it’s not like he does anything stupid at home. We’re just sad that my dad seemed to have lost all his fire inside. He didn’t even want to go camping anymore.’ Everyone lined up on the stone bridge, facing the water blaring down, but kept in silence. ‘But I realised he was wrong,’ Horace smiled, ‘things only stop happening because you chose to stop doing it. It’s too early to give up after just one set back. I have you guys to thank for teaching me this.’ Lu and Alya nodded slowly. Alright, it’s too early for such a heart-to-heart conversation. ‘Oi Horace! I thought you said no petition talk allowed? Come on!’ ‘I didn’t bring it up! I was just explaining my hobby.’ Annata interrupted, pointing at the mountain top at the distance. ‘Anyway! Shall we keep going?’ The woods were smaller than Chase’d thought. They already walked out in the open in less than half an hour, and on a nicely paved pebble path that ran along the side of the slope that went all the way to the top, where the viewing area was. Although they’d walked through some steep slopes, Chase was amazed at the sight of the mist flowing among the treetops beneath him, as if he’d just ascended to heaven and walking on the clouds, lit up by the morning sun. The route was busier than Chase expected too. In the following hour, they’d met at least ten groups, ranging from families, young couples to high schoolers, all going the opposite direction. They must had all gone to see the sunrise, which Chase and the others had missed. Finally, Ariel, who had been trying to keep up, demanded for a break, so everyone took a quick stop at a viewing platform. ‘How out of shape are you?’ Annata looked at the panting Ariel on the bench, looking disbelief. ‘I am not that out of shape actually, I just… just… not used to carrying a heavy backpack.’ ‘What? How do you go to school then?’ ‘Yeah, I swear I am fit in other sports. You remember how I jumped on that bicycle and chased down Mrs Kim just before the winter test? At the boat house?’ ‘Oh I remember that,’ Alya said as she passed a water bottle to Ariel, ‘you just took off into the darkness. I had to sprint on my bike to catch you up!’ ‘See Annata? Don’t patronise me!’ Annata smirked. ‘Very well, but… did you ever return the bicycle to Lenny?’ Ariel bounced up like a frightened cat. ‘Oh crap…’ Here’s my chance! ‘And don’t forget your reaction time is still rubbish!’ Chase added as he lifted the bottle that Ariel was drinking from. Ariel coughed out a mouthful of water immediately, it reminded Chase of a soft drink can being crushed by a car. ‘How did you two become friends? It’s not the first I’ve seen you picking on Ariel.’ Lu asked. Ariel put his hand up. ‘Can I just be clear? I am friends with Horace, and barely with this guy. Who on earth enjoys being bullied?’ ‘Fine. How did you three become friends anyway?’ ‘We were in the same class in Grade 1, class 1A. We didn’t know each other at first, but got assigned to the same History group project and got to know each other. Especially, Horace and I, we both had a common interest in Zentrum Union.’ Annata looked confused. ‘Why? What’s interesting about it? My mum said it’s the unhappiest country in the world and people from there are illiterate and barbaric and selfish. They are having days of protesting in Melian City because Zentrumians are taking our jobs too. And it’s so close to Pyon!’ Lu nodded in agreement. ‘They sell the majority of the crops and vegetables to us too. They have been making our food more and more expensive. And their migrants keep coming here. It’s just a pain.” However, Horace and Ariel’s eyes sparkled. ‘What’s not interesting? They are so close to us but no one knows what they are up to. They could be making a secret weapon, or time machine, or digging a tunnel to Pyon under River Perryson. It’s so secret and always sort of shrouded in the fog. Don’t you wonder what they do over there every day?’ Ariel said excitedly. Has Ariel always been this silly? ‘No I don’t.’ ‘Well you should.’ Horace took over the conversation. Chase wondered why they are so enthusiastic about those guys as well. He was pretty sure that they didn’t have aliens or some super nuclear weapon, probably just normal people trying to make a living and going to schools like they do. ‘My dad has been there once on a patrol. He said the streets felt like going back forty years.’ Horace continued, ‘but apparently some people drove in luxury cars and some buildings looked even cooler than we have in Melian City. Yet somehow people are still secretly coming here on migrant boats.’ Alya, although leading the group at some distance ahead like a scout leader, heard the talking and joined in. ‘Yeah, yeah! Ariel, we rowing club sent the White Maiden to your dad’s workshop after it hit a boat in the middle of the night. Probably it was a migrant boat?’ Chase disagreed. ‘No chance. It was way bigger than ours. One of the seniors on it swore he said the boat said “Pyon Border Patrol” on it after the fog suddenly thickened and they crashed.’ ‘But why’d they drive away if it were the border patrol? Surely they’d call for backup.’ ‘Beats me.’ A sudden powerful gust nearly pushed Chase down when he stepped out from the rock next to the hiking path. He knew they finally made it to the top of the mountain. That conversation on Zentrum Union kept droning on and on, Chase felt so bored that he nearly abandoned everyone to dash up here. Not surprisingly, the view was absolutely gorgeous. Like Horace promised, he could see the a few dozen skyscrapers towering through the sky among a sea of buildings of Melian City on the east, and on the other side, a vast and flat outline of Zentrum Union hidden behind the fog. To this day, despite having the same view from the Noodle Bar for nearly every day for the last fourteen years, Chase was still unsure if there were houses or villages on the other side of the river. ‘Wow! It’s incredible!’ Alya screamed against the strong wind. Everyone seemed to be drawn to the Melian City side, except Ariel and Horace. ‘Found anything?’ Chase asked as he slapped on Ariel’s shoulder. Horace pointed at a large bridge in distant. It spanned across River Perryson and it looked like a long stick floating above the thin fog. ‘That’s Harmony Bridge. We normally don’t see it in Pierra because it’s too far away. It’s the only bridge that links us to Zentrum Union, but my dad used to say it’s anything but harmony. Hardly anyone except the government and the military use it. They said most of the Zentrumians aren’t allowed to cross it even.’ ‘Really? I guess that’s why there are so many of them risking their lives on boats smuggling here.’ A helicopter slow wheezed along the river. It projected a ray of searchlight, panning left and right but there was nothing on the surface. ‘Hey! What’s there to see over here?’ Annata and Lu came over. ‘We are just looking at Zentrum Union.’ Annata grunted. ‘What’s so interesting about it? I hated that place.’ ‘Why?’ Alya asked. ‘As I said, they are taking people’s jobs. People are out of work because everyone, even the government is starting to hire cheaper Zentrumians. The next thing you’ll know it’s they will fire Ariel’s mum and hire a Zentrumian instead!’ ‘You don’t know that!’ Ariel protested, ’also, what’s wrong with offering a job to someone who’s willing to work hard? Shouldn’t they deserve a chance when they’ve tried their best to come here and make a living?’ ‘They should, but…’ Annata sighed, ‘my mum always said there’s a line between helping others and looking after yourself. They said food prices are rising and some of my uncles and aunts are losing their jobs to Zentrumians for no reason. They are interfering with us but we can’t interfere with them. I just can’t feel sympathy for them at all.’ Chase was both bored and confused by the level of conversation they were having. Aren’t we just at Grade 2? What sort of serious social issues we tackling here? ‘You are right, but…’ ‘What date is today?’ Horace interrupted and caught everyone’s attention. ‘Today is… 15th of March 2011 right? How many days have we started the petition?’ Alya stammered whilst the others stood silent in confusedly. ‘Uhh… about five months?’ ‘Five months… that’s five months without the Debating Club already,‘ Horace said as he watched the calm riverbanks of Zentrum Union, ‘can’t believe I have gotten used to it already, but for some reason, that energy never faded away.’ ‘I was never in the Debating Club, but I know what you mean.’ Alya agreed, ‘just listening to you guys arguing all the time, and yet moving to the same direction. What’s so different from the Debating Club?’ I guess we just like arguing. Chase murmured to himself quietly. The wind was picking up again. ‘So, I don’t know what will happen to the Debating Club, or to me,’ Horace continued, ‘but I know we’d rather try and fail than failing to try. And I think that’s good enough.’ Chase felt the urge to clap, but held himself back because it was too embarrassing. ‘I disagree with one thing, Horace,’ Lu said happily as she raised her smartphone, ‘I know what’s going to happen to you and the club. And I think we are going to be okay!’ Everyone gathered around her immediately to read what was on the screen. It had one new message from Maula, the Debating Club president. Working in secret over the last few months, she had just managed to obtain over 200 signatures from the Pierra residents."

      "chapterTitle": "Chapter 11 – The Big Day",
      "text": "The last two weeks felt like an eternity for Annata, and the others likely felt the same too. When Lu showed everyone the message that they had finally received the signatures needed by the Student Council and Mrs Kim, a heavy rock was lifted from Annata’s chest. She felt so relieved that she felt on to the ground. She had never enjoyed a camping trip as much as this in her life. Finally, we did it… Now that the holiday was over, she came to the Rowing Club meeting room before the school started. It was still too early for anyone to be in, but luckily Alya gave her a backup key secretly. Only First Tier team members were allowed to have them. Dashing up one floor, she unlocked the meeting room door in a split second, it was almost a reflex now. There were dozens of signature sheets, filled with names that they collected since October last year. Without any hesitation, Annata eagerly swept all of the papers into a plastic folder that she brought. Then she took down a few more papers from the whiteboard and placed them into the same folder. She felt her hands were shaking and sweating in the palms. It felt like harvesting a field after months of hard work. All that work had built up to this day. This was it, and Annata prayed she had not missed anything that Mrs Kim had asked for to keep Horace and the Debating Club. ‘Relax.’ A calm voice came out from behind. Ironically, that scored Annata. ‘Oh Horace, it’s you.’ ‘You are here even more early than I am. I appreciate all the help, but you are way too intense about this.’ Horace said worriedly. ‘We can’t waste one more day. We need to get these to Mrs Kim as soon as we can. Do you think we can knock on her door straight after the morning assembly?’ ‘I don’t think so. We still have our first period. It’s not a good idea if we sneak out just to meet the principal.’ ‘You’re right.’ The morning sun had grown a little brighter, and a few students were already on the way to school. ‘Maula texted me earlier, she has the other signatures at hand, so she’s gonna meet us outside the Principal’s Office at lunchtime.’ ‘Okay.’ Annata scanned through the room again. This had been the heart for the battle for many months, so many fights and emotions happened under this roof, but Annata hoped she’d never have to see this room again. We finally save Horace today. At noon, as soon as the chime for the lunchtime rang its first tune, Annata dashed out from the 2A classroom. Lu, Alya and Chase followed closely from behind like a team of firefighters. She had been looking forward to this day for so long, yet when today finally came, it felt unprepared. Deep inside, she had doubts whether they’d ever gotten enough signatures for the Student Council and Mrs Kim. But none of that mattered anymore. Annata hopped down a few steps to save time in the stairwell. She could hear the others did the same as well. Seconds later, they arrived outside the Principal’s Office, panting like they just caught on the last train. Maula, the Debating Club president, and a few seniors were already there. ‘Hi Annata! Thank you for doing so much for our club and Horace, but you might want to… tidy yourself up first before we knock.’ Annata took a large breathe to stop the panting. As she tidied her short hair, straightened up her uniform and brushed off the dust on her skirt, Horace arrived, followed by Ariel. Clutching the signature sheets in her hands, with Maula having the rest of them, she nodded at her friends. ‘Let’s go.’ Horace smiled and took the first step, and knocked on Mrs Kim’s door. It was Annata’s first time in the Principal Office since Mrs Kim took charge. She was called in when she skipped school last year. The photographs that used to be on the wall with years of students, school events and celebrations had been replaced with Mrs Kim’s university certifications and recognitions. The office had become a personal statement rather than a recollection of memories. It disgusted Annata. Mrs Kim, dressed in a perfectly-ironed black suit, efficiently typing something on her laptop. It seemed that she didn’t notice them at all. Horace went ahead. ‘Sorry to disturb Mrs Kim. We…’ ‘Give me one minute Horace, let me finish this report.’ She lifted one finger, gesturing Horace to quiet down. Annata and Horace glanced at each other nervously. A few awkward silent moments later, she finally stopped typing and looked up. ‘Right, I see this is probably about the Debating Club? Presumably you have got enough signatures?’ Horace nodded and put down all six signature sheets on the desk. ‘Yes, that’s correct. Although I cannot deny not playing a part in causing disturbance in the Debating Conference that night, we strongly reject that the Debating Club to be disbanded because it is a very popular student club, one of the most prominent clubs that defines our school!’ ‘You are right Horace. Unfortunately, I have received complaints from the locals through the PTA. I cannot overlook that.’ ‘Which is why we also have the signatures from the locals.’ Maula put down anther stack of signature sheets on the desk. ‘More than 500 signatures, all signed by the locals.’ Annata stepped forward. ‘According to the school rules, any petition…’ ‘What’s your name?’ Mrs Kim asked. Dammit. ‘Annata.’ ‘Annata, I know the rules well. Any request that is signed by over 2/3 of the student-body, which is 600 students, must be carefully considered by the Principal and other senior staff members. In this case, I also asked for another 500 signatures from the local residents. I know you guys have collected 623 student signatures and 533 resident signatures, by going round every club and standing at the school gate, and also standing in the streets, correct?’ Annata and Horace nodded. ‘That’s really well done. I am impressed.’ Mrs Kim smiled and picked up the papers and read them carefully. ‘Debating Club is really quite something, eh? Can I take these and I will need to discuss with Mr Hong. Come back after school.’ Annata sighed a great relieve in her heart. ‘Thank you Mrs Kim!’ All of them took a deep bow and walked out from the room. ‘Horace.’ Mrs Kim called out. ‘Yes miss?’ ‘Can you stay behind for a bit longer? I’d like to speak with you.’ She gestured him to take a seat and closed the door. * * * ‘Yeah! I think we did it!’ Chase ran around and hi-fived everyone as they took a seat at Chase’s Noodle Bar for lunch. Chase’s parents quickly handed everyone a bowl of beef noodles with a smile. ‘These are on the house. I am so happy that you guys succeeded. Well done!’ Annata, however, felt a little uneasy. What are Mrs Kim and Horace talking about? Half way through the noodles, Horace came in, looking confused. ‘She basically congratulated me on making it to the target.’ Horace explained calmly, ‘then she asked me on a few things, like what my parents did for a living, did I have any plans if I didn’t make it. It was a little strange but I answered truthfully.’ ‘That’s strange…’ ‘Anyway. I think we have succeeded now!’ Horace became seriously suddenly. Annata knew he was going to make another formal thank you, which he did. ‘I don’t know how to thank you guys.’ He took a deep bow. ‘How many times do you have to bow to us? I thought we talked about this already? I am getting tired of this.’ Chase said as he pulled Horace to sit down at the bar. ‘Sit down and try some of our best beef noodles.’ For a moment, Annata missed the feeling of chasing after a target. The fight and the struggle were too stressful for anyone to remember, but maybe it doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be missed. ‘You okay?’ Alya asked. ‘Yeah, I am fine.’ Annata was sure that Alya would think she was crazy if she told her what just flashed through her mind. Maula joined in with the rest of the seniors from the Debating Club. Chase seemed even more overjoyed that his family restaurant was now packed with people, but Annata wished there were fewer people. ‘Especially you, Annata,’ Horace added, ‘this wouldn’t have happened if you didn’t take initiative. I’d already given up, but you kept to your plan and trusted us.’ Trusted? Did I actually trust anyone? Maula and everyone else applauded as loudly as possible. Annata felt embarrassed that she was treated like a hero just slayed a dragon for the village, but she stood up and smiled. ‘I am so happy for you guys.’ Chase’s parents smiled whilst cleaning up behind the counter. ‘Thank you for the meals, Uncle Lyn and Aunt Lyn. It was delicious.’ Lu handed in her bowl. ‘Are you leaving already?’ ‘I am afraid so. There’s an English test in the next period and I haven’t revised properly.’ Just when Lu left, Lee showed up at the door. ‘Ah! The girl that knocked me over in the hallway! I’ve been looking for you.’ Annata was taken aback when Lee suddenly said to her. ‘Wait… why?’ ‘Why?’ Lee looked more confused than her. ‘Dude! You are the number-one school celebrity now! Everyone is talking about how you have successfully defied the all-mighty Mrs Kim and the Student Council. Truth be told, nobody expected you to collect all those signatures but you did anyway. And thanks to you, the Documentary Photography Club has gotten a lot more views now.’ ‘Oh, of course.’ Annata nearly forgot the deal between them, which is having Lee reporting their petition and they would mention the club during the petition, but Annata wasn’t sure if the others actually did so. ‘You didn’t upload any photos besides the ones we picked right?’ ‘Yes of course. Mind if I have an interview with you and Horace?’ Annata noticed Lu had been staring at him. Still holding a grudge on privacy invasion? ‘Umm… sure, but…’ Annata wanted to just finish lunch and go back to the classroom. ‘How about with Horace first?’ Lee happily wandered off to Horace, leaving Annata with some peace to finish the noodles. * * * That evening, Annata and the others went to Mrs Kim’s office again, but she had already left, but her secretary told them to try again the next day. ‘I am curious. What’s your plan B if we didn’t meet the target?’ Alya asked on their ways back home. The sunset above Zentrum Union in the background had made the scenery really cinematic. Horace was about to reveal something but he stopped himself. He replied with a smile, ‘it doesn’t matter anymore does it?’ The next morning, they tried again, but she wasn’t in either. No luck on the following day either. At the end of the week, finally, the chair was no longer empty when they were allowed in. Mrs Kim was, as usual, in her perfectly-ironed suit. However, this time, Mr Hong, the Deputy Principal, was also in the room, standing next to Mrs Kim. ‘Sorry. I had been on a business trip for the last couple of days. You must be all dying to hear that confirmation.’ Mrs Kim said with a smile. ‘You all did very well to collect all those signatures. I think it speaks volume, don’t you think Mr Hong?’ ‘Certainly. The Debating Club has always been one of our proudest and most prestigious school clubs in Central Pierra.’ ‘And I heard Horace is one of our best students too.’ ‘Thank you Mrs Kim.’ Horace nodded slightly. ‘I have been discussing this with the school board in the last couple of days,’ she continued, ‘I think you started the petition, didn’t you Annata?’ ‘Yes. Mrs Kim.’ ‘Going around to every single school club and asked them for signatures, standing at the school gate rallying, even asking for help in the park and online. Very clever and a lot of hard work indeed, and all planned and discussed at the Rowing Club meeting room. I must say Mr Hong and I are both very impressed.’ Annata jerked when she heard the meeting room being mentioned. She was completely certain that no one knew about the meeting room except them and a few people at the rowing club. Mrs Kim shouldn’t know anything outside what she saw in-person and from Lee’s online posts. Lu voiced up. ‘Sorry Mrs Kim. Does this mean that we can carry on with the Debating Club and Horace will not be expelled?’ Mrs Kim sighed. ‘No, I am afraid not. You are not allowed to keep the club, and Horace, we cannot allow you to stay with us either.’ Annata thought she heard something wrong. ‘What?’ Mr Hong answered. ‘You see. Although the Debating Club is very popular, we have some students complained that the topics of discussion were getting too extreme and disturbing.’ ‘That’s not true!’ Annata shouted. ‘And you have never said that before!’ Mr Hong looked back disapprovingly. ‘Also, of course, on top of that we had local residents complaining and it’s a financial burden. We cannot keep the Debating Club. You must disband.’ Annata was struggling to contain her rage, she felt her hands were trembling uncontrollably. ‘But you promised that if we got enough signatures…’ ‘We promised that if you have enough signatures, we’d consider revoking our decision.’ Annata wanted to call them liars, but she knew she’d get in serious trouble immediately. She glanced at the others. Alya looked shocked, covering her face with both hands; Lu was looking at the ground silently; Horace looked disappointed; both Ariel and Chase were angry like she was. ‘What about Horace? Why are you so insistent on expelling him?’ ‘We cannot overlook that fact that he was named by the PTA and the residents as the culprit.’ Mrs Kim chimed in, ‘and also, we have sources to say that… you forced some of the students to signing your petition.’ ‘What? That’d never…’ ‘Don’t talk back.’ Mrs Kim had lost her smile at this point. ‘You did, to be precise, at the Drama Club.’ She then took out a digital voice recorder and clicked play. Alya’s voice came on. “Have a little think, guys, why would he get such a severe punishment when he was just doing club activities like they have been doing for years? The same might happen to the Drama Club, you know.” Annata could feel that she could explode any moment. This is bad. Really bad. Alya looked pale, shaking her head uncontrollably and started to cry while Lu was comforting her. Chase and Ariel just stared at both adults angrily in silent. ‘I think we could have been gentler with them.’ Horace explained calmly. ‘We were simply trying to explain to them why, in our opinion that this punishment is unfair, and they disagreed with us, but we meant no offense or threats to them. It was an honest mistake. My apologies.’ ‘I am afraid even with that percentage of student signatures and taking into account of the public signatures, we cannot overlook this.’ Mr Hong concluded. ‘This is rubbish!’ Maula protested. Several other seniors followed suit. ‘Yeah what are you think about?!’ ‘Can’t believe you!’ ‘None of that made sense!’ ‘QUIET!’ Mrs Kim shouted, slamming both her hands on the desk. The room returned to silent immediately, but the hostility was still strong. ‘Or what? Are you going to expel us? We are going to leave tomorrow to take the university entrance exams anyway.’ Maula challenged. ‘You see. This is exactly why Debating Club has to go. Rebellion and disgraceful behaviours like this have no place in Central Pierra.’ Mrs Kim concluded. After a few moments, she sat back down. ‘I am afraid the school’s decision is final. Debating Club must disband and there will be no such student organisation next year. And Horace Pham, you can no longer study at Central Pierra. Your last day will be the final day of this school term in three months.’ * * * Annata felt she couldn’t breathe, despite standing in the hallway and facing the fresh air for ten minutes already. Deep inside, she’d prepared for the worst, but seeing what Mrs Kim responded earlier this week, she never expected to be this bad. Basically all that work went into nothing. It was a waste of time and effort. Annata was disgusted by that thought. She found herself grasping for air, hoping to climb out from the pit of hopelessness. Her hands were trembling. I was confident that we could make it… I had a plan… maybe if I collected more signatures… maybe if I could gather more people… Endless ‘what-ifs’ flashed through her mind, but all of them reminded her that she failed to save her friend. She dared not to look at Horace, so she carefully glanced at the others instead. Alya was comforting Lu this time instead, who struggled to stop sobbing; Chase leaned against the wall, staring at his feet emptily. Ariel was holding on a small silver box, tapping his finger. ‘What’s that?’ Alya asked. ‘A hard disk.’ ‘Why are you holding it?’ ‘I am thinking.’ Ariel said. The shouting in Mrs Kim’s office briefly interrupted them. After they’d told to dismiss, the seniors insisted on staying in the room to defend themselves. They are the Debating Club after all. It’s only right to defend yourselves. A few minutes later, they had appeared to calm down in the office. ‘I am not sure if this would help, but…’ Ariel said, holding up the hard disk. ‘Well, what’s is it?’ ‘One of the Rowing Club members found this in the White Maiden boat and gave it to me. They thought I lost it because my dad fixed the boat in his workshop.’ ‘And how does it help our situation?’ ‘It has a file on it. It contains a PowerPoint that explains how Zentrum Union prepares to infiltrate Central Pierra Secondary School. The first step is removing the Debating Club and some of the most popular students.’ Lu grunted. ‘That’s stupid.’ ‘Can’t say I disagree, but I didn’t make this up. This was really found on the boat.’ ‘How did it end up there?’ ‘I don’t know, they said the White Maiden hit a Pyon Border Patrol boat in the fog. It was a pretty heavy crash so it might have fallen off from the patrol boat.’ ‘I wanted to say it’s stupid too, but…’ Annata went on, calculating the odds of continuing the argument, ‘it’s not like we have anything to lose. Let’s ask them then.’ ‘What? Just walk in and ask if they knew about this?’ Chase looked up in surprise. ‘Yeah, why not? If they knew nothing about it, they’d just think we’ve been messing about. If they did, they’d know we are not as naïve as they thought we are.’ Annata then turned to Ariel. ‘I know I said that I didn’t believe in your conspiracy theories and you are out of your mind, but I don’t have any better ideas.’ Annata knocked on the door, and walked in with Ariel and Horace. ‘Mrs Kim. I have something to show you.’ Ariel said to a bemused Mrs Kim as he plugged the hard disk into his laptop. He opened up the PowerPoint. ‘I have happened to come across this a few months back. Do you know anything about this?’ Annata observed Mrs Kim closely, but she didn’t look surprised. ‘What is this?’ ‘It’s a plan made by the Zentrum Union government, which looks like from their… um… Department for Strategic Development. Do you know or heard anything about this?’ ‘No I haven’t.’ ‘Really? There are some interesting points in here.’ Annata challenged. ‘This shows how Zentrum Union infiltrates this school by replacing the principal with one of their own, and slowly changed the school rules one by one.’ ‘And here is what we found next.’ ‘This part looks strangely familiar. Look, disbanding Debating Club and expelling a few popular students with the aim being “improvement of assertion of further control in the school with limiting opportunities of freedom of speech and thinking” because apparently “students might not behave in their best interests”, does that remind you?’ ‘How dare you?!’ Mrs Kim jumped up furiously. The kind and friendly face that everyone had been seeing finally showed its true colours. For a moment, Annata had wished that Mrs Kim was the lovely new principal that everyone believed her to be, but she wasn’t sure that it’d still be the case after she ruthlessly crushed their hard work. ‘Are you accusing me being a Zentrum Union spy? Just to carry out this… this ridiculous “plan” and expel a random student? You think I picked Horace just to upset everyone?’ Annata thought she was about to climb over the desk and choke her. ‘Of course not.’ Horace chipped in with a smile. ‘We all wanted the best for the school don’t we? We were not accusing you, but since someone made this… PowerPoint. We think it’s best that Mr Hong and you should be at least aware of it.’ Mrs Kim calmed down a little. ‘Fine. We are aware of this now, anything else?’ They shook their heads. ‘Okay, everyone dismissed. Including you guys too, Maula.’ * * * A familiar voice called out from the back. Annata thought she might have heard her name, but didn’t want to look back. However, the voice was becoming more insistent by the minute. So noisy… Lee’s face showed up. Between the muffled voice, it sounded like he was asking how did the conversation go, or could he take a few pictures, or he was sorry to hear to outcome, Annata wasn’t sure because everything sounded distorted. That’s it. We’ve failed. Some moments late, she found herself sitting in her seat in her empty classroom. Horace, Lu, Alya, Chase, and Ariel scattered around the room. No one spoke. A younger-looking boy knocked on the door. ‘I heard what happened. I am so, so, so sorry to hear what happened to you, Horace.’ The boy said. ‘Ah, you are Ariel’s friend, Pavel? Thank you.’ Horace replied with a bitter smile. ‘Is there anything I could help?’ ‘Thanks, but not right now Pavel. Thank you.’ Ariel calmly dismissed him and closed the classroom door. The sunset had turned the sky golden, as if the clouds were on fire. It was beautiful, but it wouldn’t last long. Horace broke the silence after a few moments. ‘It wasn’t your fault, Annata.’ ‘Eh?’ Alya agreed. ‘Horace is right. It wasn’t your fault at all, Annata. Don’t be so upset about it.’ ‘How can I not be? It was my plan! It was my idea and I made everyone did what I asked them to. We worked so, so hard for so long and… and still failed! Why did I even bother trying in the first if we are going to fail anyway? Waste of time!!’ Annata burst out crying. ‘But you didn’t fail.’ Miss Swanson, the class teacher for 2B, spoke up. It turned out she had been watching in the hallway. ‘Look, you brought your friends and the whole school, even half of the town together didn’t you? You have tried to save your friend and the Club. It’s a lot better and more admirable than just not doing anything.’ Annata sighed. So what? ‘You might not understand it now, but you will see there is no such thing as an useless experience. When you work hard, you will always get something back. I promise.’ Miss Swanson continued comforting Annata. ‘Miss Swanson is right,’ Horace said and hopped down from the desk he’d been sitting on, ‘when did I ever blame you for helping out? Never! I thank you and all of you from the bottom of my heart. Indeed, none of us wanted this, but we are at where we are now.’ ‘But what are you going to do? Can you transfer to another school?’ Ariel asked. ‘Well, I wasn’t able to. I was going to take a part-time job and support my parents and my little sister. We just can’t afford the school fees, I’d rather my little sister to go to a good school.’ ‘Can you apply for a new scholarship like you do here?’ ‘Maybe, but at least not for another six months… Listen, the plan changed now. I think I have no choice but go with Plan B. It was an arrangement made by an acquaintance of my dad. ’ ‘Plan B?’ ‘Yes, Plan B.’ Horace said sternly. ‘I am leaving Pyon.’"
